<p>C<small>APTAIN</small> S<small>OTO</small> was the son of a squire of <i>Xerez of Badajoz</i>.
He went into the Spanish <i>Indies</i>, when <i>Peter Arias</i> of <i>Avila</i> was
Governor of the <i>West Indies</i>. And there he was without anything
else of his own, save his sword and target: and for his good qualities
and valor, <i>Peter Arias</i> made him captain of a troop of horsemen,
and by his commandment he went with <i>Fernando Pizarro</i> to the
conquest of <i>Peru</i>: where (as many persons of credit reported, which
were there present) as well at the taking of <i>Atabalipa</i>, Lord of <i>Peru</i>,
as at the assault of the city of <i>Cusco</i>, and in all other places where
they found resistance, wheresoever he was present, he passed all other
captains and principal persons. For which cause, besides his part of
the treasure of <i>Atabalipa</i>, he had a good share; whereby in time he
gathered a hundred and four score thousand ducats together, with
that which fell to his part; which he brought into Spain; whereof
the Emperor borrowed a certain part, which he repaid again with
60,000 rials of plate in the rent of the silks of <i>Granada</i>, and all the
rest was delivered him in the contractation house of <i>Seville</i>. He took
servants to wit, a steward, a gentleman usher, pages, a gentleman of
the horse, a chamberlain, lackeys, and all other officers that the house of
a noble may require. From <i>Seville</i> he went to the court, and in the
court, there accompanied him <i>John Danusco</i> of <i>Seville</i>, and <i>Lewis
Moscoso D'Alvarado</i>, <i>Nuño de Touar</i>, and <i>John Rodriguez Lobillo</i>.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>
Except <i>John Danusco</i>, all the rest came with him from <i>Peru</i>: and
every one of them brought fourteen or fifteen thousand ducats: all
of them went well and costly appareled. And although <i>Soto</i> of his
own nature was not liberal, yet because that was the first time that
he was to show himself in the court, he spent frankly, and went
accompanied with those which I have named, and with his servants,
and many others which resorted unto him. He married with <i>Donna
Isabella de Bobadilla</i>, daughter of <i>Peter Arias</i> of <i>Avila</i>, Earl of
<i>Punno en Rostro</i>. The Emperor made him the Governor of the Isle
of <i>Cuba</i>, and Adelantado or President of <i>Florida</i>; with a title of
Marquis of certain part of the lands that he should conquer.</p>

<p>When <i>Don Ferdinando</i> had obtained the government, there
came a gentleman from the <i>Indies</i> to the court, named <i>Cabeça de
Vaca</i>, which had been with the Governor <i>Pamphilo de Narvaez</i>
which died in <i>Florida</i>, who reported that <i>Narvaez</i> was cast away at
sea with all the company that went with him. And how he with
four more escaped and arrived in <i>Nueva España</i>. Also he brought
a relation in writing, of that which he had seen in <i>Florida</i>; which
said in some places: In such a place I have seen this; and the rest
which here I saw, I leave to confer of between his Majesty and myself.
Generally he reported the misery of the country, and the
troubles which he passed: and he told some of his kinsfolk, which
were desirous to go into the <i>Indies</i>, and urged him very much to tell
them whether he had seen any rich country in <i>Florida</i>, that he
might not tell them, because he and another, whose name was <i>Orantes</i>,
(who remained in <i>Nueva España</i> with purpose to return into
<i>Florida</i>: for which intent he came into <i>Spain</i> to beg the government
thereof of the Emperor) had sworn not to discover some of
those things which they had seen, because no man should prevent
them in begging the same. And he informed them <i>that it was the
richest country of the world</i>. <i>Don Ferdinando de Soto</i> was very
desirous to have him with him, and made him a favorable offer: and
after they were agreed, because <i>Soto</i> gave him not a sum of money
which he demanded to buy a ship, they broke off again. <i>Baltasar de
Gallegos</i>, and <i>Christopher de Spindola</i>, the kinsmen of <i>Cabeça de
Vaca</i>, told him, that for that which he had imparted to them, they
were resolved to pass with <i>Soto</i> into <i>Florida</i>, and therefore they
prayed him to advise them what they were best to do. <i>Cabeça de
Vaca</i> told them, that the cause why he went not with <i>Soto</i>, was because
he hoped to beg another government, and that he was loth to
go under the command of another: and that he came to beg the conquest<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>
of <i>Florida</i>: but seeing <i>Don Ferdinando de Soto</i> had gotten it
already, for his oath's sake he might tell them nothing of that which
they would know: but he counseled them to sell their goods and go
with him, and that in so doing they should do well. As soon as he
had opportunity, he spake with the Emperor, and related unto him
whatsoever he had passed and seen, and come to understand. Of this
relation, made by word of mouth to the Emperor, the Marquis of
<i>Astorya</i> had notice, and forthwith determined to send with <i>Don Ferdinando
de Soto</i> his brother <i>Don Antonio Osorio</i>: and with him two
kinsmen of his prepared themselves, to wit, <i>Francis Osorio</i>, and
<i>Garcia Osorio</i>. <i>Don Antonio</i> dispossessed himself of 60,000 rials
of rent which he held by the church; and <i>Francis Osorio</i> of a town
of vassals, which he had in the country <i>de Campos</i>. And they
made their rendezvous with the Adelantado in <i>Seville</i>. The like did
<i>Nuñez de Touar</i>, and <i>Lewis de Moscoso</i>, and <i>John Rodriguez Lobillo</i>,
each of whom had brought from <i>Peru</i> fourteen or fifteen thousand
ducats. <i>Lewis de Moscoso</i> carried with him two brethren; there went
also <i>Don Carlos</i>, which had married the governor's niece, and took
her with him. From <i>Badajoz</i> there went <i>Peter Calderan</i>, and three
kinsmen of the Adelantado, to wit, <i>Arias Tinoco</i>, <i>Alfonso Romo</i>, and
<i>Diego Tinoco</i>. And as <i>Lewis de Moscoso</i> passed through <i>Elvas</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
<i>Andrew de Vasconcelos</i> spake with him, and requested him to speak
to <i>Don Ferdinando de Soto</i> concerning him, and delivered him certain
warrants which he had received from the Marquis of <i>Villa Real</i>,
wherein he gave him the captainship of <i>Ceuta</i> in <i>Barbarie</i>, that he
might show them unto him. And the Adelantado saw them; and was
informed who he was, and wrote unto him, that he would favor him
in all things, and by all means, and would give him a charge of men
in <i>Florida</i>. And from <i>Elvas</i> went <i>Andrew de Vasconcelos</i>, and <i>Fernan
Pegado</i>, <i>Antonio Martinez Segurado</i>, <i>Men Roiz Pereira</i>, <i>John
Cordero</i>, <i>Stephen Pegado</i>, <i>Benedict Fernandez</i>, and <i>Alvaro Fernandez</i>.
And out of <i>Salamanca</i>, and <i>Jaen</i>, and <i>Valencia</i>, and <i>Albuquerque</i>,
and from other parts of <i>Spain</i>, many people of noble birth, assembled
at <i>Seville</i>, insomuch that in Saint <i>Lucar</i> many men of good
account, which had sold their goods, remained behind for want of
shipping, whereas for other known and rich countries, they are wont
to want men: and this fell out by occasion of that which <i>Cabeça de
Vaca</i><a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> told the Emperor, and informed such persons as he had conference<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>
withal touching the state of that country. <i>Soto</i> made him
great offers, and being agreed to go with him (as I have said before)
because he would not give him money to pay for a ship, which he had
bought, they brake off, and he went for governor to the river of <i>Plate</i>.
His kinsmen, <i>Christopher de Spindola</i> and <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i>, went
with <i>Soto</i>. <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i> sold houses and vineyards, and rent
corn, and ninety ranks of olive trees in the <i>Xarafe of Seville</i>. He had
the office of <i>Alcalde Mayor</i>, and took his wife with him. And there
went also many other persons of account with the President, and had
the offices following by great friendship, because they were offices
desired of many, to wit, <i>Antonie de Biedma</i> was factor, <i>John
Danusco</i> was auditor, and <i>John Gaytan</i>, nephew to the Cardinal of
<i>Ciguenza</i>, had the office of treasurer.</p>

<p>The Portuguese departed from <i>Elvas</i> the 15th of January, and
came to <i>Seville</i> the 19th of the same month, and went to the lodging
of the Governor, and entered into a court, over the which were certain
galleries where he was, who came down and received them at the
stairs, whereby they went up into the galleries. When he was come
up, he commanded chairs to be given them to sit on. And <i>Andrew
de Vasconcelos</i> told him who he and the other Portuguese were, and
how they all were come to accompany him, and serve him in his
voyage. He gave him thanks, and made show of great contentment
for his coming and offer. And the table being already laid, he invited
them to dinner. And being at dinner, he commanded his
steward to seek a lodging for them near unto his own, where they
might be lodged. The Adelantado departed from <i>Seville</i> to <i>Saint
Lucar</i> with all the people which were to go with him. And he commanded
a muster to be made, at the which the Portuguese showed themselves
armed in very bright armor, and the Castellans very gallant
with silk upon silk, with many pinkings and cuts. The Governor, because
these braveries in such an action did not like him, commanded that
they should muster another day, and every one should come forth
with his armor; at the which the Portuguese came as at the first armed
with very good armor. The Governor placed them in order near
unto the standard, which the ensign bearer carried. The Castellans,
for the most part, did wear very bad and rusty shirts of mail, and all
of them head-pieces and steel caps, and very bad lances. Some of
them sought to come among the Portuguese. So those passed and
were counted and enrolled which <i>Soto</i> liked and accepted of, and did
accompany him into <i>Florida</i>; which were in all six hundred men.
He had already bought seven ships, and had all necessary provision<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>
aboard them. He appointed captains, and delivered to every one his
ship, and gave them in a roll what people every one should carry with
them.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord 1538, in the month of April, the Adelantado
delivered his ships to the captains which were to go in them;
and took for himself a new ship, and good of sail, and gave another
to <i>Andrew de Vasconcelos</i>, in which the Portuguese went; he went
over the bar of <i>St. Lucar</i> on Sunday, being <i>St. Lazarus</i> day, in the
morning of the month and year aforesaid, with great joy, commanding
his trumpets to be sounded, and many shots of the ordnance to be
discharged. He sailed four days with a prosperous wind, and suddenly
it calmed; the calms continued eight days with swelling seas, in such
wise that we made no way. The fifteenth day after his departure from
<i>St. Lucar</i>, he came to <i>Gomera</i>, one of the <i>Canaries</i>, on Easter day
in the morning. The Earl of that island was appareled all in white,
cloak, jerkin, hose, shoes and cap, so that he seemed a Lord of the
Gipsies. He received the Governor with much joy; he was well
lodged, and all the rest had their lodgings gratis, and got great store
of victuals for their money, as bread, wine, and flesh; and they took
what was needful for their ships, and the Sunday following, eight days
after their arrival, they departed from the Isle of <i>Gomera</i>. The Earl
gave to <i>Donna Isabella</i>, the Adelantado's wife, a bastard daughter
that he had, to be her waiting-maid. They arrived at the <i>Antilles</i>, in
the Isle of <i>Cuba</i>, at the port of the city of <i>St. Jago</i>, upon Whit-sunday.
As soon as they came thither, a gentleman of the city sent to the sea-side
a very fair roan horse, and well furnished, for the Governor, and a mule
for <i>Donna Isabella</i>, and all the horsemen and footmen that were in
the town came to receive him at the sea-side. The Governor was well
lodged, visited, and served of all the inhabitants of the city, and all
his company had their lodgings freely: those which desired to go into
the country, were divided by four and four, and six and six, in the
farms or granges, according to the ability of the owners of the farms,
and were furnished by them with all things necessary.</p>

<p>The city of <i>St. Jago</i> hath fourscore houses, which are great and well
contrived. The most part have their walls made of boards, and are
covered with thatch; it hath some houses built with lime and stones,
and covered with tiles. It hath great orchards and many trees in them,
differing from those of Spain: there be fig trees which bear figs as big
as one's fist, yellow within, and of small taste; and other trees which
bear a fruit which they call Ananes, in making and bigness like to a
small pineapple: it is a fruit very sweet in taste: the shell being taken<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>
away, the kernel is like a piece of fresh cheese. In the granges
abroad in the country there are other great pineapples, which grow
on low trees, and are like the Aloe tree: they are of a very good smell
and exceeding good taste. Other trees do bear a fruit which they call
Mameis, of the bigness of peaches. This the islanders do hold for
the best fruit of the country. There is another fruit which they call
Guayabas, like filberts, as big as figs. There are other trees as high
as a javelin, having one only stock without any bough, and the leaves
as long as a casting dart; and the fruit is of the bigness and fashion
of a cucumber; one bunch beareth twenty or thirty, and as they ripen
the tree bendeth downward with them: they are called in this country
Plantanos, and are of a good taste, and ripen after they be gathered;
but those are the better which ripen upon the tree itself; they bear
fruit but once, and the tree being cut down, there spring up others
out of the but, which bear fruit the next year. There is another fruit,
whereby many people are sustained, and chiefly the slaves, which are
called Batatas. These grow now in the Isle of <i>Terçera</i>, belonging to
the kingdom of <i>Portugal</i>, and they grow within the earth, and are
like a fruit called Iname; they have almost the taste of a chestnut.
The bread of this country is also made of roots which are like the
Batatas.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> And the stock whereon those roots do grow is like an elder
tree: they make their ground in little hillocks, and in each of them
they thrust four or five stakes; and they gather the roots a year and
a half after they set them. If any one, thinking it is a batata or
potato root, chance to eat of it never so little, he is in great danger of
death: which was seen by experience in a soldier, which as soon as
he had eaten a very little of one of those roots, he died quickly. They
pare these roots and stamp them, and squeeze them in a thing like a
press: the juice that cometh from them is of an evil smell. The
bread is of little taste and less substance. Of the fruits of <i>Spain</i>,
there are figs and oranges, and they bear fruit all the year, because the
soil is very rank and fruitful. In this country are many good horses,
and there is green grass all the year. There be many wild oxen and
hogs, whereby the people of the island are well furnished with flesh.
Without the towns abroad in the country are many fruits. And it
happeneth sometimes that a Christian goeth out of the way and is
lost fifteen or twenty days, because of the many paths in the thick
groves that cross to and fro made by the oxen; and being thus lost
they sustain themselves with fruits and palmîtos&mdash;for there be many<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>
great groves of palm trees through all the island&mdash;they yield no other
fruit that is of any profit. The Isle of <i>Cuba</i> is three hundred leagues
long from the east to the west, and is in some places thirty, in others
forty leagues from north to south. It hath six towns of Christians,
to wit, <i>St. Jago</i>, <i>Baracôa</i>, <i>Bayamo</i>, <i>Puerto de Principes</i>, <i>S. Espirito</i>,
and <i>Havana</i>. Every one hath between thirty and forty households,
except <i>St. Jago</i> and <i>Havana</i>, which have about sixty or eighty houses.
They have churches in each of them, and a chaplain which confesseth
them and saith mass. In <i>St. Jago</i> is a monastery of Franciscan
friars; it hath but few friars, and is well provided of alms, because
the country is rich. The Church of <i>St. Jago</i> hath honest revenue,
and there is a curate and prebends, and many priests, as the church of
that city, which is the chief of all the island. There is in this country
much gold and few slaves to get it; for many have made away
themselves, because of the Christians' evil usage of them in the mines.
A steward of <i>Vasquez Porcallo</i>, which was an inhabitor in that island,
understanding that his slaves would make away themselves, stayed for
them with a cudgel in his hand at the place where they were to meet,
and told them that they could neither do nor think anything that he
did not know before, and that he came thither to kill himself, with
them, to the end, that if he had used them badly in this world, he
might use them worse in the world to come: and this was a means
that they changed their purpose, and turned home again to do that
which he commanded them.</p>

<p>The Governor sent from <i>St. Jago</i> his nephew <i>Don Carlos</i>, with the
ships in company of <i>Donna Isabella</i> to tarry for him at <i>Havana</i>,
which is a haven in the west part toward the head of the island,
one hundred and eighty leagues from the city of <i>St. Jago</i>. The
Governor, and those which stayed with him, bought horses and proceeded
on their journey. The first town they came unto was <i>Bayamo</i>:
they were lodged four and four, and six and six, as they went in company,
and where they lodged, they took nothing for their diet, for
nothing cost them aught save the maize or corn for their horses, because
the Governor went to visit them from town to town, and seized
them in the tribute and service of the Indians. <i>Bayamo</i> is twenty-five
leagues from the city of <i>St. Jago</i>. Near unto the town passeth
a great river which is called <i>Tanto</i>; it is greater than <i>Guadiana</i>, and
in it be very great crocodiles, which sometimes hurt the Indians, or
the cattle which passeth the river. In all the country are neither
wolf, fox, bear, lion, nor tiger. There are wild dogs which go from
the houses into the woods and feed upon swine. There be certain<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>
snakes as big as a man's thigh or bigger; they are very slow, they do
no kind of hurt. From <i>Bayamo</i> to <i>Puerto de los Principes</i> are fifty
leagues. In all the island from town to town, the way is made by
stubbing up the underwood; and if it be left but one year undone,
the wood groweth so much that the way cannot be seen, and the paths
of the oxen are so many, that none can travel without an Indian of
the country for a guide: for all the rest is very high and thick woods.
From <i>Puerto de los Principes</i> the Governor went to the house of <i>Vasquez
Porcallo</i> by sea in a boat (for it was near the sea) to know there
some news of <i>Donna Isabella</i>, which at that instant (as afterwards
was known) was in great distress, insomuch that the ships lost one
another, and two of them fell on the coast of <i>Florida</i>, and all of them
endured great want of water and victuals. When the storm was over,
they met together without knowing where they were: in the end they
descried the Cape of <i>St. Anton</i>, a country not inhabited of the island
of <i>Cuba</i>; there they watered, and at the end of forty days, which
were passed since their departure from the city of <i>St. Jago</i>, they arrived
at <i>Havana</i>. The Governor was presently informed thereof, and
went to <i>Donna Isabella</i>. And those which went by land, which were
one hundred and fifty horsemen, being divided into two parts, because
they would not oppress the inhabitants, traveled by <i>St. Espirito</i>, which
is sixty leagues from <i>Puerto de los Principes</i>. The food which they
carried with them was <i>Caçabe</i> bread, which is that whereof I made
mention before: and it is of such a quality that if it be wet it breaketh
presently, whereby it happened to some to eat flesh without bread for
many days. They carried dogs with them, and a man of the country,
which did hunt; and by the way, or where they were to lodge that
night, they killed as many hogs as they needed. In this journey
they were well provided of beef and pork, and they were greatly
troubled with musquitoes, especially in a lake, which is called the
mere of <i>Pia</i>, which they had much ado to pass from noon till night.
The water might be some half league over, and to be swam about a
crossbow shot; the rest came to the waist, and they waded up to the
knees in the mire, and in the bottom were cockle shells, which cut
their feet very sore, in such sort that there was neither boot nor
shoe sole that was whole at half way. Their clothes and saddles
were passed in baskets of palm trees. Passing this lake, stripped out
of their clothes, there came many mosquitoes, upon whose biting
there arose a wheal that smarted very much; they struck them with
their hands, and with the blow which they gave they killed so many
that the blood did run down the arms and bodies of the men. That<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>
night they rested very little for them, and other nights also in the
like places and times. They came to <i>Santo Espirito</i>, which is a town
of thirty houses; there passeth by it a little river; it is very pleasant
and fruitful, having great store of oranges and citrons, and fruits of
the country. One-half of the company were lodged here, and the
rest passed forward twenty-five leagues to another town called la
<i>Trinidad</i>, of fifteen or twenty households. Here is an hospital for
the poor, and there is none other in all the island. And they say
that this town was the greatest in all the country, and that before the
Christians came into this land, as a ship passed along the coast
there came in it a very sick man, which desired the captain to set
him on shore, and the captain did so, and the ship went her way.
The sick man remained set on shore in that country, which until then
had not been haunted by Christians; whereupon the Indians found
him, carried him home, and looked unto him till he was whole; and
the lord of that town married him unto a daughter of his, and had
war with all the inhabitants round about, and by the industry and
valor of the Christian, he subdued and brought under his command
all the people of that island. A great while after, the Governor
<i>Diego Velasques</i> went to conquer it, and from thence discovered <i>New
Spain</i>. And this Christian which was with the Indians did pacify
them, and brought them to the obedience and subjection of the governor.
From this town <i>de la Trinidad</i> unto <i>Havana</i> are eighty
leagues, without any habitation, which they traveled. They came
to <i>Havana</i> in the end of March, where they found the Governor, and
the rest of the people which came with him from <i>Spain</i>. The Governor
sent from <i>Havana John Dannusco</i> with a caravele and two
brigantines with fifty men to discover the haven of <i>Florida</i>, and from
thence he brought two Indians which he took upon the coast, wherewith
(as well because they might be necessary for guides and for interpreters,
as because they said by signs that there was much gold in
<i>Florida</i>) the Governor and all the company received much contentment,
and longed for the hour of their departure, thinking in himself
that this was the richest country that unto that day had been discovered.</p>

<p>Before our departure the Governor deprived <i>Nuño de Touar</i> of
the office of Captain-general, and gave it to <i>Porcallo de Figueroa</i>, an
inhabitant of <i>Cuba</i>, which was a mean that the ship was well furnished
with victuals; for he gave a great many loads of <i>Casabe</i> bread
and many hogs. The Governor took away this office from <i>Nuño de
Touar</i>, because he had fallen in love with the daughter of the Earl<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>
of <i>Gomera</i>, <i>Donna Isabella's</i> waiting-maid, who, though his office
were taken from him (to return again to the Governor's favor), though
she were with child by him, yet took her to his wife, and went with
<i>Soto</i> into <i>Florida</i>. The Governor left <i>Donna Isabella</i> in <i>Havana</i>,
and with her remained the wife of <i>Don Carlos</i>, and the wives of <i>Baltasar
de Gallegos</i>, and of <i>Nuño de Touar</i>. And he left for his lieutenant
a gentleman of <i>Havana</i>, called <i>John de Roias</i>, for the government
of the island.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 18th of May, in the year of our Lord 1539, the
Adelantado or president departed from <i>Havana</i> in <i>Cuba</i> with his
fleet, which were nine vessels, five great ships, two caravels, and two
brigantines. They sailed seven days with a prosperous wind. The
25th day of May, the day <i>de Pasca de Spirito Santo</i><a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> (which we
call Whitson Sunday), they saw the land of <i>Florida</i>, and because of
the shoals, they came to an anchor a league from the shore. On
Friday the 30th of May they landed in <i>Florida</i>, two leagues from a
town of an Indian lord called <i>Ucita</i>. They set on land two hundred
and thirteen horses, which they brought with them to unburden the
ships, that they might draw the less water. He landed all his men,
and only the seamen remained in the ships, which in eight days,
going up with the tide every day a little, brought them up unto the
town. As soon as the people were come on shore, he pitched his
camp on the sea-side, hard upon the bay which went up unto the
town. And presently the Captain-general, <i>Vasquez Porcallo</i>, with
other seven horsemen foraged the country half a league round about,
and found six Indians, which resisted him with their arrows, which
are the weapons which they used to fight withal. The horsemen killed
two of them, and the other four escaped; because the country is cumbersome
with woods and bogs, where the horses stuck fast, and fell
with their riders, because they were weak with traveling upon the
sea. The same night following, the Governor with an hundred men
in the brigantines lighted upon a town, which he found without
people, because that as soon as the Christians had sight of land, they
were descried, and saw along the coast many smokes, which the Indians
had made to give advice the one to the other. The next day
<i>Luys de Moscoso</i>, master of the camp, set the men in order, the horsemen
in three squadrons, the vanguard, the battalion, and the rereward;
and so they marched that day and the day following, compassing great
creeks which came out of the bay. They came to the town of <i>Ucita</i>,<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>
where the Governor was on Sunday the first of June, being Trinity
Sunday. The town was of seven or eight houses. The lord's house
stood near the shore upon a very high mount, made by hand for
strength. At another end of the town stood the church, and on the
top of it stood a fowl made of wood with gilded eyes. Here were
found some pearls of small value, spoiled with the fire, which the Indians
do pierce and string them like beads, and wear them about their
necks and handwrists, and they esteem them very much. The houses
were made of timber, and covered with palm leaves. The Governor
lodged himself in the lord's houses, and with him <i>Vasquez Porcallo</i>,
and <i>Luys de Moscoso</i>; and in others that were in the midst of the
town, was the chief Alcalde or justice, <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i> lodged;
and in the same houses was set in a place by itself all the provision
that came in the ships; the other houses and the church were broken
down, and every three or four soldiers made a little cabin wherein
they lodged. The country round about was very fenny, and encumbered
with great and high trees. The Governor commanded to fell the
woods a crossbow shot round about the town, that the horses might
run, and the Christians might have the advantage of the Indians, if
by chance they should set upon them by night. In the ways and
places convenient they had their sentinels of footmen by two and two
in every stand, which did watch by turns, and the horsemen did visit
them, and were ready to assist them if there were any alarm. The
Governor made four captains of the horsemen and two of the footmen.
The captains of the horsemen were one of them <i>Andrew de Masconcelos</i>,
and another <i>Pedro Calderan de Badajoz</i>; and the other two were his
kinsmen, to wit, <i>Arias Tinoco</i>, and <i>Alfonso Romo</i>, born likewise in
<i>Badajoz</i>. The captains of the footmen, the one was <i>Francisco
Maldonado of Salamanca</i>, and the other <i>Juan Rodriguez Lobillo</i>.
While we were in this town of <i>Ucita</i>, the two Indians which <i>John
Danusco</i> had taken on that coast, and the Governor carried along with
him for guides and interpreters, through carelessness of two men
which had the charge of them escaped away one night; for which the
Governor and all the rest were very sorry, for they had already made
some roads, and no Indians could be taken, because the country was
full of marsh grounds, and in some places full of very high and thick
woods.</p>

<p>From the town of <i>Ucita</i> the Governor sent the Alcalde mayor,
<i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i>, with forty horsemen and eighty footmen into
the country to see if they could take any Indians; and the Captain
<i>John Rodriguez Lobillo</i> another way with fifty footmen: the most of<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>
them were swordsmen and targeters, and the rest were shot and crossbow-men.
They passed through a country full of bogs, where horses
could not travel. Half a league from the camp they lighted upon,
certain cabins of Indians near a river. The people that were in them
leaped into the river, yet they took four Indian women. And twenty
Indians charged us and so distressed us, that we were forced to retire
to our camp, being, as they are, exceeding ready with their weapons.
It is a people so warlike and so nimble, that they care not a whit for
any footmen. For if their enemies charge them they run away, and if
they turn their backs they are presently upon them. And the thing
that they most flee is the shot of an arrow. They never stand still,
but are always running and traversing from one place to another, by
reason whereof neither crossbow nor arquebuss can aim at them; and
before one crossbowman can make one shot an Indian will discharge
three or four arrows, and he seldom misseth what he shooteth at. An
arrow where it findeth no armor, pierceth as deeply as a crossbow.
Their bows are very long, and their arrows are made of certain canes
like reeds, very heavy, and so strong that a sharp cane passeth through
a target. Some they arm in the point with a sharp bone of a fish
like a chisel, and in others they fasten certain stones like points of
diamonds. For the most part when they light upon an armor they
break in the place where they are bound together. Those of cane do
split and pierce a coat of mail, and are more hurtful than the other.
<i>John Rodriguez Lobillo</i> returned to the camp with six men wounded,
whereof one died; and brought the four Indian women which <i>Baltasar
Gallegos</i> had taken in the cabins or cottages. Two leagues
from the town, coming into the plain field, he espied ten or eleven
Indians, among whom was a Christian, which was naked and scorched
with the sun, and had his arms razed after the manner of the Indians,
and differed nothing at all from them. And as soon as the horsemen
saw them they ran toward them. The Indians fled, and some of them
hid themselves in a wood, and they overtook two or three of them
which were wounded; and the Christian seeing a horseman run upon
him with his lance, began to cry out, "Sirs, I am a Christian, slay me
not, nor these Indians, for they have saved my life." And straightway
he called them and put them out of fear, and they came forth of
the wood unto them. The horsemen took both the Christian and
the Indians up behind them, and toward night came into the camp
with much joy; which thing being known by the Governor, and them
that remained in the camp, they were received with the like.</p>

<p>This Christian's name was <i>John Ortiz</i>, and he was born in <i>Seville</i>,<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>
of worshipful parentage. He was twelve years in the hands of the
Indians. He came into this country with <i>Pamphilo de Narvaez</i>, and
returned in the ships to the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, where the wife of the
Governor <i>Pamphilo de Narvaez</i> was, and by his commandment with
twenty or thirty others in a brigantine returned back again to <i>Florida</i>,
and coming to the port in the sight of the town, on the shore they
saw a cane sticking in the ground, and riven at the top, and a letter
in it; and they believed that the governor had left it there to give
advertisement of himself when he resolved to go up into the land,
and they demanded it of four or five Indians which walked along the
sea-shore, and they bade them by signs to come on shore for it,
which against the will of the rest <i>John Ortiz</i> and another did. And
as soon as they were on land, from the houses of the town issued a
great number of Indians, which compassed them about and took them
in a place where they could not flee; and the other, which sought to
defend himself, they presently killed upon the place, and took John
<i>Ortiz</i> alive, and carried him to <i>Ucita</i> their lord. And those of
the brigantine sought not to land, but put themselves to sea, and returned
to the Island of <i>Cuba</i>. <i>Ucita</i> commanded to bind <i>John Ortiz</i>
hand and foot upon four stakes aloft upon a raft, and to make a fire
under him, that there he might be burned. But a daughter of his
desired him that he would not put him to death, alleging that one only
Christian could do him neither hurt nor good, telling him that it was
more for his honor to keep him as a captive. And <i>Ucita</i> granted her
request, and commanded him to be cured of his wounds; and as soon
as he was whole he gave him the charge of the keeping of the temple,
because that by night the wolves did carry away the dead corpses
out of the same&mdash;who commended himself to God and took upon him
the charge of his temple. One night the wolves got from him the
corpse of a little child, the son of a principal Indian, and going after
them he threw a dart at one of the wolves, and struck him that carried
away the corpse, who, feeling himself wounded left it, and fell
down dead near the place; and he not woting what he had done, because
it was night, went back again to the temple; the morning being
come and finding not the body of the child, he was very sad. As
soon as <i>Ucita</i> knew thereof he resolved to put him to death, and sent
by the track which he said the wolves went, and found the body of
the child, and the wolf dead a little beyond, whereat <i>Ucita</i> was much
contented with the Christian, and with the watch which he kept in
the temple, and from thenceforward esteemed him much. Three
years after he fell into his hands there came another lord called<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>
<i>Mocoço</i>, who dwelleth two days' journey from the port, and burnt his
town. <i>Ucita</i> fled to another town that he had in another sea-port.
Thus <i>John Ortiz</i> lost his office and favor that he had with him.
These people being worshipers of the devil, are wont to offer up unto
him the lives and blood of their Indians, or of any other people they
can come by; and they report that when he will have them do that
sacrifice unto him, he speaketh with them, and telleth them that he
is athirst, and willeth them to sacrifice unto him. <i>John Ortiz</i> had
notice by the damsel that had delivered him from the fire, how her
father was determined to sacrifice him the day following, who willed
him to flee to <i>Mocoço</i>, for she knew that he would use him well; for
she heard say that he had asked for him and said he would be glad to
see him, and because he knew not the way she went with him half a
league out of the town by night and set him in the way, and returned
because she would not be discovered. <i>John Ortiz</i> traveled all
that night, and by the morning came to a river which is the territory
of <i>Mocoço</i>, and there he saw two Indians fishing; and because they
were in war with the people of <i>Ucita</i>, and their languages were different,
and he knew not the language of <i>Mocoço</i>, he was afraid, because
he could not tell them who he was, nor how he came thither, nor was
able to answer anything for himself, that they would kill him, taking
him for one of the Indians of <i>Ucita</i>, and before they espied him he
came to the place where they had laid their weapons; and as soon as
they saw him they fled toward the town, and although he willed them
to stay, because he meant to do them no hurt, yet they understood
him not, and ran away as fast as ever they could. And as soon as
they came to the town with great outcries, many Indians came forth
against him, and began to compass him to shoot at him. <i>John Ortiz</i>
seeing himself in so great danger, shielded himself with certain trees,
and begun to shriek out and cry very loud, and to tell them that he
was a Christian, and that he was fled from <i>Ucita</i>, and was come to see
and serve <i>Mocoço</i> his lord. It pleased God that at that very instant
there came thither an Indian that could speak the language and understood
him, and pacified the rest, who told them what he said.
Then ran from thence three or four Indians to bear the news to their
lord, who came forth a quarter of a league from the town to receive
him, and was very glad of him. He caused him presently to swear
according to the custom of the Christians, that he would not run
away from him to any other lord, and promised him to entreat him
very well; and that if at any time there came any Christians into
that country, he would freely let him go, and give him leave to go to<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>
them; and likewise took his oath to perform the same according to
the Indian custom. About three years after certain Indians, which
were fishing at sea two leagues from the town, brought news to
<i>Mocoço</i> that they had seen ships, and he called <i>John Ortiz</i> and gave
him leave to go his way, who taking his leave of him, with all the
haste he could came to the sea, and finding no ships he thought it to
be some deceit, and that the cacique had done the same to learn his
mind. So he dwelt with <i>Mocoço</i> nine years, with small hope of seeing
any Christians. As soon as our Governor arrived in <i>Florida</i>, it
was known to <i>Mocoço</i>, and straightway he signified to <i>John Ortiz</i> that
Christians were lodged in the town of <i>Ucita</i>; and he thought he had
jested with him as he had done before, and told him that by this time
he had forgotten the Christians, and thought of nothing else but to
serve him. But he assured him that it was so, and gave him license
to go unto them, saying unto him that if he would not do it, and if
the Christians should go their way, he should not blame him, for he
had fulfilled that which he had promised him. The joy of <i>John Ortiz</i>
was so great, that he could not believe that it was true; notwithstanding
he gave him thanks, and took his leave of him, and <i>Mocoço</i> gave
him ten or eleven principal Indians to bear him company; and as they
went to the port where the Governor was, they met with <i>Baltasar de
Gallegos</i>, as I have declared before. As soon as he was come to the
camp, the Governor commanded to give him a suit of apparel, and
very good armor, and a fair horse; and inquired of him whether he
had notice of any country where there was any gold or silver. He
answered, No, because he never went ten leagues compass from the
place where he dwelt; but that thirty leagues from thence<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> dwelt an
Indian lord, which was called <i>Paracossi</i>, to whom <i>Mocoço</i> and <i>Ucita</i>,
with all the rest of that coast paid tribute, and that he peradventure
might have notice of some good country, and that his land was better
than that of the sea-coast, and more fruitful and plentiful of maize.
Whereof the Governor received great contentment, and said that he
desired no more than to find victuals, that he might go into the main
land, for the land of <i>Florida</i> was so large, that in one place or other
there could not choose but be some rich country. The <i>Cacique
Mocoço</i> came to the port to visit the Governor, and made this speech
following.</p>

<p>"Right high and mighty lord, I being lesser in mine own conceit
for to obey you, than any of those which you have under your command,<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>
and greater in desire to do you greater services, do appear before
your lordship with so much confidence of receiving favor, as if in
effect this my good will were manifested unto you in works; not for
the small service I did unto you touching the Christian which I had
in my power, in giving him freely his liberty (for I was bound to do
it to preserve mine honor, and that which I had promised him), but
because it is the part of great men to use great magnificences. And
I am persuaded that as in bodily perfections, and commanding of good
people, you do exceed all men in the world, so likewise you do in the
parts of the mind, in which you may boast of the bounty of nature.
The favor which I hope for of your lordship is, that you would hold me
for yours, and bethink yourself to command me anything wherein I
may do you service."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him, "That although in freeing and sending
him the Christian, he had preserved his honor and promise, yet
he thanked him, and held it in such esteem as it had no comparison;
and that he would always hold him as his brother, and would favor all
things to the utmost of his power." Then he commanded a shirt to
be given him, and other things, wherewith the cacique being very
well contented, took his leave of him, and departed to his own town.</p>

<p>From the Port <i>de Spirito Santo</i> where the Governor lay, he sent
the Alcalde Mayor <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i> with fifty horsemen, and
thirty or forty footmen to the province of <i>Paracossi</i>, to view the disposition
of the country, and inform himself of the land farther inward,
and to send him word of such things as he found. Likewise
he sent his ships back to the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, that they might return
within a certain time with victuals. <i>Vasquez Porcallo de Figueroa</i>,
which went with the Governor as Captain-general, (whose principal
intent was to send slaves from <i>Florida</i> to the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, where
he had his goods and mines,) having made some inroads, and seeing
no Indians were to be got, because of the great bogs and woods that
were in the country, considering the disposition of the same, determined
to return to <i>Cuba</i>. And though there was some difference between
him and the Governor, whereupon they neither dealt nor conversed
together with good countenance, yet notwithstanding with
loving words he asked him leave and departed from him. <i>Baltasar
de Gallegos</i> came to the <i>Paracossi</i>. There came to him thirty Indians
from the cacique, which was absent from his town, and one of them
made this speech:</p>

<p>"Paracossi, the lord of this province, whose vassals we are, sendeth<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>
us unto your worship, to know what it is that you seek in this his
country, and wherein he may do you service."</p>

<p><i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i> said unto him that he thanked them very
much for their offer, willing them to warn their lord to come to his
town, and that there they would talk and confirm their peace and
friendship, which he much desired. The Indians went their way and
returned next day, and said that their lord was ill at ease, and therefore
could not come; but that they came on his behalf to see what he
demanded. He asked them if they knew or had notice of any rich
country where there was gold or silver. They told him they did,
and that towards the west there was a province which was called
<i>Cale</i>; and that others that inhabited other countries had war with the
people of that country, where the most part of the year was summer,
and that there was much gold; and that when those their enemies
came to make war with them of <i>Cale</i>, these inhabitants of <i>Cale</i> did
wear hats of gold, in manner of head-pieces. <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i>
seeing that the cacique came not, thinking all that they said was
feigned, with intent that in the meantime they might set themselves
in safety, fearing that if he did let them go, they would return
no more, commanded the thirty Indians to be chained, and sent
word to the Governor by eight horsemen what had passed; whereof
the Governor with all that were with him at the Port <i>de Spirito
Santo</i> received great comfort, supposing that that which the Indians
reported might be true. He left Captain <i>Calderan</i> at the port, with
thirty horsemen and seventy footmen, with provision for two years,
and himself with all the rest marched into the main land, and came
to the <i>Paracossi</i>, at whose town <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i> was; and from
thence with all his men took the way to <i>Cale</i>. He passed by a little
town called <i>Acela</i>, and came to another called <i>Tocaste</i>; and from
thence he went before with thirty horsemen and fifty footmen towards
<i>Cale</i>. And passing by a town whence the people were fled, they saw
Indians a little distance from thence in a lake, to whom the interpreter
spoke. They came unto them and gave them an Indian for a guide;
and he came to a river with a great current, and upon a tree which
was in the midst of it, was made a bridge, whereon the men passed;
the horses swam over by a hawser, that they were pulled by from the
other side; for one, which they drove in at the first without it, was
drowned. From thence the Governor sent two horsemen to his people
that were behind, to make haste after him; because the way grew
long, and their victuals short. He came to <i>Cale</i>, and found the town
without people. He took three Indians which were spies, and tarried<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>
there for his people that came after, which were sore vexed with hunger
and evil ways, because the country was very barren of maize,
low, and full of water, bogs, and thick woods; and the victuals which
they brought with them from the <i>Port de Spirito Santo</i>, were spent.
Wheresoever any town was found, there were some beets, and he that
came first gathered them, and sodden with water and salt, did eat them
without any other thing; and such as could not get them, gathered
the stalks of maize and eat them, which because they were young had
no maize in them. When they came to the river which the Governor
had passed, they found palmîtos upon low palm trees like those of
<i>Andalusia</i>. There they met with the two horsemen which the Governor
sent unto them, and they brought news that in <i>Cale</i> there was
plenty of maize, at which news they all rejoiced. As soon as they
came to <i>Cale</i>, the Governor commanded them to gather all the maize
that was ripe in the field, which was sufficient for three months. At
the gathering of it the Indians killed three Christians, and one of them
which were taken told the Governor, that within seven days' journey
there was a very great province, and plentiful of maize, which was
called <i>Apalache</i>. And presently he departed from <i>Cale</i> with fifty
horsemen, and sixty footmen. He left the master of the camp, <i>Luys
de Moscoso</i>, with all the rest of the people there, with charge that he
should not depart thence until he had word from him. And because
hitherto none had gotten any slaves, the bread that every one was to
eat he was fain himself to beat in a mortar made in a piece of timber,
with a pestle, and some of them did sift the flour through their shirts
of mail. They baked their bread upon certain tileshares which they
set over the fire, in such sort as heretofore I have said they used to do
in <i>Cuba</i>. It is so troublesome to grind their maize, that there were
many that would rather not eat it than grind it; and did eat the
maize parched and sodden.</p>

<p>The second day of August, 1539, the Governor departed from
<i>Cale</i>; he lodged in a little town called <i>Ytara</i>, and the next day in another
called <i>Potano</i>, and the third day at <i>Utinama</i>, and came to another
town which they named the town of <i>Evil peace</i>; because an Indian
came in peace, saying, that he was the cacique, and that he
with his people would serve the Governor, and that if he would set
free twenty-eight persons, men and women, which his men had taken
the night before, he would command provision to be brought him, and
would give him a guide to instruct him in his way. The Governor
commanded them to be set at liberty, and to keep him in safeguard.
The next day in the morning there came many Indians, and set themselves<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>
round about the town near to a wood. The Indian wished
them to carry him near them, and that he would speak unto them, and
assure them, and that they would do whatsoever he commanded them.
And when he saw himself near unto them he broke from them, and
ran away so swiftly from the Christians that there was none that
could overtake him, and all of them fled into the woods. The Governor
commanded to loose a greyhound, which was already fleshed
on them, which passing by many other Indians, caught the counterfeit
cacique which had escaped from the Christians, and held him till they
came to take him. From thence the Governor lodged at a town called
<i>Cholupaha</i>, and because it had store of maize in it, they named it
<i>Villa farta</i>. Beyond the same there was a river, on which he made
a bridge of timber, and traveled two days through a desert. The
17th of August he came to <i>Caliquen</i>, where he was informed of the
province of <i>Apalache</i>. They told him that <i>Pamphilo de Narvaez</i> had
been there, and that there he took shipping, because he could find no
way to go forward. That there was none other town at all; but that
on both sides was all water. The whole company were very sad for
this news, and counseled the Governor to go back to the <i>Port de
Spirito Santo</i>, and to abandon the country of <i>Florida</i>, lest he should
perish as <i>Narvaez</i> had done; declaring that if he went forward, he
could not return back when he would, and that the Indians would
gather up that small quantity of maize which was left. Whereunto
the Governor answered that he would not go back, till he had seen
with his eyes that which they reported; saying that he could not
believe it, and that we should be put out of doubt before it were
long. And he sent to <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> to come presently from
<i>Cale</i>, and that he tarried for him there. <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> and
many others thought that from <i>Apalache</i> they should return back;
and in <i>Cale</i> they buried their iron tools, and divers other things.
They came to <i>Caliquen</i> with great trouble; because the country
which the Governor had passed by, was spoiled and destitute of
maize. After all the people were come together, he commanded a
bridge to be made over a river that passed near the town. He
departed from <i>Caliquen</i> the 10th of September, and carried the cacique
with him. After he had traveled three days, there came Indians
peaceably to visit their lord, and every day met us on the way
playing upon flutes; which is a token that they use, that men may
know that they come in peace. They said that in our way before
there was a cacique whose name was <i>Uzachil</i>, a kinsman of the cacique
of <i>Caliquen</i> their lord, waiting for him with many presents, and they<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>
desired the Governor that he would loose the cacique. But he would
not, fearing that they would rise, and would not give him any guides,
and sent them away from day to day with good words. He traveled
five days; he passed by some small towns; he came to a town called
<i>Napetuca</i>, the 15th day of September. Thither came fourteen or fifteen
Indians, and besought the Governor to let loose the cacique of
<i>Caliquen</i>, their lord. He answered them that he held him not in
prison, but that he would have him to accompany him to Uzachil.
The Governor had notice by <i>John Ortiz</i>, that an Indian told him how
they determined to gather themselves together, and come upon him,
and give him battle, and take away the cacique from him. The day
that it was agreed upon, the Governor commanded his men to be in
readiness, and that the horsemen should be ready armed and on horseback
every one in his lodging, because the Indians might not see
them, and so more confidently come to the town. There came four
hundred Indians in sight of the camp with their bows and arrows,
and placed themselves in a wood, and sent two Indians to bid the Governor
to deliver them the cacique. The Governor with six footmen
leading the cacique by the hand, and talking with him, to secure the
Indians, went toward the place where they were. And seeing a fit
time, commanded to sound a trumpet; and presently those that were
in the town in the houses, both horse and foot, set upon the Indians,
which were so suddenly assaulted, that the greatest care they had was
which way they should flee. They killed two horses; one was the
Governor's, and he was presently horsed again upon another. There
were thirty or forty Indians slain. The rest fled to two very great
lakes, that were somewhat distant the one from the other. There they
were swimming, and the Christians round about them. The calivermen
and crossbow-men shot at them from the bank; but the distance
being great, and shooting afar off, they did them no hurt. The Governor
commanded that the same night they should compass one of
the lakes, because they were so great, that there were not men enough
to compass them both; being beset, as soon as night shut in, the Indians,
with determination to run away, came swimming very softly to
the bank; and to hide themselves they put a water lily leaf on their
heads. The horsemen, as soon as they perceived it to stir, ran into
the water to the horses' breasts, and the Indians fled again into the
lake. So this night passed without any rest on both sides. <i>John Ortiz</i>
persuaded them that seeing they could not escape, they should yield
themselves to the Governor; which they did, enforced thereunto by the
coldness of the water; and one by one, he first whom the cold did<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>
first overcome, cried to <i>John Ortiz</i>, desiring that they would not kill
him, for he came to put himself into the hands of the Governor. By
the morning watch they made an end of yielding themselves; only
twelve principal men, being more honorable and valorous than the
rest, resolved rather to die than to come into his hands. And the
Indians of <i>Paracossi</i>, which were now loosed out of chains, went
swimming to them, and pulled them out by the hair of their heads,
and they were all put in chains, and the next day were divided among
the Christians for their service. Being thus in captivity, they determined
to rebel; and gave in charge to an Indian which was interpreter,
and held to be valiant, that as soon as the Governor did come
to speak with him, he should cast his hands about his neck, and
choke him: who, when he saw opportunity, laid hands on the Governor,
and before he cast his hands about his neck, he gave him
such a blow on the nostrils, that he made them gush out with
blood, and presently all the rest did rise. He that could get any
weapons at hand, or the handle wherewith he did grind the maize,
sought to kill his master, or the first he met before him; and he that
could get a lance or sword at hand, bestirred himself in such sort with
it, as though he had used it all his lifetime. One Indian in the market-place
enclosed between fifteen or twenty footmen, made a way like
a bull, with a sword in his hand, till certain halbardiers of the Governor
came, which killed him. Another got up with a lance to a loft made
of canes, which they build to keep their maize in, which they call a
barbacoa, and there he made such a noise as though ten men had
been there defending the door; they slew him with a partizan. The
Indians were in all about two hundred men. They were all subdued.
And some of the youngest the Governor gave to them which had
good chains, and were careful to look to them that they got not
away. All the rest he commanded to be put to death, being tied
to a stake in the midst of the market-place; and the Indians of
the <i>Paracossi</i> did shoot them to death.</p>

<p>The Governor departed from <i>Napetuca</i> the 23d of September; he
lodged by a river, where two Indians brought him a buck from the
cacique of <i>Uzachil</i>. The next day he passed by a great town called
<i>Hapaluya</i>, and lodged at <i>Uzachil</i>, and found no people in it, because
they durst not tarry for the notice the Indians had of the
slaughter of <i>Napetuca</i>. He found in that town great store of maize,
French beans, and pompions, which is their food, and that wherewith
the Christians there sustained themselves. The maize is like coarse
millet, and the pompions are better and more savory than those of<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>
<i>Spain</i>. From thence the Governor sent two captains each a sundry
way to seek the Indians. They took an hundred men and women;
of which as well there as in other place where they made any inroads,
the captain chose one or two for the Governor, and divided the
rest to himself, and those that went with him. They led these Indians
in chains with iron collars about their necks; and they served
to carry their stuff, and to grind their maize, and for other services
that such captives could do. Sometimes it happened that going for
wood or maize with them, they killed the Christian that led them,
and ran away with the chain; others filed their chains by night with
a piece of stone, wherewith they cut them, and use it instead of iron.
Those that were perceived paid for themselves, and for the rest, because
they should not dare to do the like another time. The women
and young boys, when they were once an hundred leagues from their
country, and had forgotten things, they let go loose, and so they
served; and in a very short space they understood the language of
the Christians. From <i>Uzachil</i> the Governor departed toward <i>Apalache</i>,
and in two days' journey he came to a town called <i>Axille</i>, and from
thence forward the Indians were careless, because they had as yet no
notice of the Christians. The next day in the morning, the first of
October, he departed from thence, and commanded a bridge to be
made over a river which he was to pass. The depth of the river
where the bridge was made, was a stone's cast, and forward a crossbow
shot the water came to the waist; and the wood whereby the
Indians came to see if they could defend the passage, and disturb
those which made the bridge, was very high and thick. The crossbow-men
so bestirred themselves that they made them give back; and
certain planks were cast into the river, whereon the men passed,
which made good the passage. The Governor passed upon Wednesday,
which was <i>St. Francis</i>' day, and lodged at a town which was
called <i>Vitachuco</i>, subject to <i>Apalache</i>: he found it burning, for the
Indians had set it on fire. From thence forward the country was
much inhabited, and had great store of maize. He passed by many
granges like hamlets. On Sunday, the 25th of October, he came to
a town which is called <i>Uzela</i>, and upon Tuesday to <i>Anaica Apalache</i>,
where the lord of all that country and province was resident; in
which town the camp master, whose office is to quarter out, and lodge
men, did lodge all the company round about within a league, and half
a league of it. There were other towns, where was great store of
maize, pompions, French beans, and plums of the country, which are
better than those of <i>Spain</i>, and they grow in the fields without planting.<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>
The victuals that were thought necessary to pass the winter,
were gathered from these towns to <i>Anaica Apalache</i>. The Governor
was informed that the sea was ten leagues from thence. He presently
sent a captain thither with horsemen and footmen. And six
leagues on the way he found a town which was named <i>Ochete</i>, and so
came to the sea; and found a great tree felled, and cut into pieces,
with stakes set up like mangers, and saw the skulls of horses. He
returned with this news. And that was held for certain, which was
reported of <i>Pamphilo de Narvaez</i>, that there he had built the barks
wherewith he went out of the land of <i>Florida</i>, and was cast away at
sea. Presently the Governor sent <i>John Danusco</i> with thirty horsemen
to the <i>Port de Spirito Santo</i> where <i>Calderan</i> was, with order
that they should abandon the port, and all of them come to <i>Apalache</i>.
He departed on Saturday the 17th of November. In <i>Uzachil</i> and
other towns that stood in the way he found great store of people
already careless. He would take none of the Indians, for not hindering
himself, because it behooved him to give them no leisure to gather
themselves together. He passed through the towns by night, and
rested without the towns three or four hours. In ten days he came
to the <i>Port de Spirito Santo</i>. He carried with him twenty Indian
women, which he took in <i>Ytara</i>, and <i>Potano</i>, near unto <i>Cale</i>, and
sent them to <i>Donna Isabella</i> in the two caravels, which he sent from
the <i>Port de Spirito Santo</i> to <i>Cuba</i>. And he carried all the footmen
in the brigantines, and coasting along the shore came to <i>Apalache</i>.
And <i>Calderan</i>, with the horsemen, and some crossbow-men on foot,
went by land; and in some places the Indians set upon him, and
wounded some of his men. As soon as he came to <i>Apalache</i>, presently
the Governor sent sawed planks and spikes to the sea-side,
wherewith was made a piragua or bark, wherein were embarked thirty
men well armed, which went out of the bay to the sea, looking for
the brigantines. Sometimes they fought with the Indians, which
passed along the harbor in their canoes. Upon Saturday, the 29th of
November, there came an Indian through the watch undiscovered,
and sat the town on fire, and with the great wind that blew two
parts of it were consumed in a short time. On Sunday the 28th
of December, came <i>John Danusco</i> with the brigantines. The Governor
sent <i>Francisco Maldonado</i>, a captain of footmen, with fifty
men to discover the coast westward, and to seek some port, because
he had determined to go by land, and discover that part. That day
there went out eight horsemen by commandment of the Governor into
the field, two leagues about the town, to seek Indians; for they were<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>
now so emboldened, that within two crossbow shot of the camp, they
came and slew men. They found two men and a woman gathering
French beans; the men, though they might have fled, yet because
they would not leave the woman, which was one of their wives, they
resolved to die fighting; and before they were slain, they wounded
three horses, whereof one died within a few days after. <i>Calderan</i>
going with his men by the sea-coast, from a wood that was near the
place, the Indians set upon him, and made him forsake his way, and
many of them that went with him forsook some necessary victuals,
which they carried with them. Three or four days after the limited
time given by the Governor to <i>Maldonado</i> for his going and coming,
being already determined and resolved, if within eight days he did
not come, to tarry no longer for him, he came, and brought an Indian
from a province which was called <i>Ochus</i>, sixty leagues westward
from <i>Apalache</i>; where he had found a port of good depth, and defence
against weather. And because the Governor hoped to find a
good country forward, he was very well contented. And he sent
<i>Maldonado</i> for victuals to <i>Havana</i>, with order that he should tarry
for him at the port of <i>Ochus</i>, which he had discovered, for he would
go seek it by land; and if he should chance to stay, and not come
thither that summer, that then he should return to <i>Havana</i>, and
should come again the next summer after, and tarry for him at that
port; for he said he would do none other thing but go to seek <i>Ochus</i>.
<i>Francisco Maldonado</i> departed, and in his place for captain of the
footmen remained <i>John de Guzman</i>. Of those Indians which were
taken in <i>Napetuca</i>, the Treasurer <i>John Gaytan</i> had a young man,
which said that he was not of that country, but of another far off
toward the sun rising, and that it was long since he had traveled to
see countries; and that his country was called <i>Yupaha</i>, and that a
woman did govern it; and that the town where she was resident was
of a wonderful bigness, and that many lords round about were tributaries
to her; and some gave her clothes, and others gold in abundance;
and he told how it was taken out of the mines, and was molten
and refined, as if he had seen it done, or the devil had taught it
him. So that all those which knew anything concerning the same,
said that it was impossible to give so good a relation, without having
seen it; and all of them, as if they had seen it, by the signs that he
gave, believed all that he said to be true.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the third of March, of the year 1540, the Governor
departed from <i>Anaica Apalache</i> to seek <i>Yupaha</i>. He commanded
his men to go provided with maize for sixty leagues of desert.<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>
The horsemen carried their maize on their horses, and the footmen at
their sides; because the Indians that were for service, with their
miserable life that they led that winter, being naked and in chains,
died for the most part. Within four days' journey they came to a great
river; and they made a piragua or ferry boat, and because of the
great current, they made a cable with chains, which they fastened on
both sides of the river; and the ferry boat went along by it, and the
horses swam over, being drawn with capstans. Having passed the
river in a day and a half, they came to a town called <i>Capachiqui</i>.
Upon Friday the 11th of March, they found Indians in arms. The
next day five Christians went to seek mortars, which the Indians
have to beat their maize, and they went to certain houses on the back
side of the camp environed with a wood. And within the wood were
many Indians which came to spy us; of the which came other five
and set upon us. One of the Christians came running away, giving
an alarm unto the camp. Those which were most ready answered
the alarm. They found one Christian dead, and three sore wounded.
The Indians fled unto a lake adjoining near a very thick wood, where
the horses could not enter. The Governor departed from <i>Capachiqui</i>
and passed through a desert. On Wednesday, the twenty-first of the
month, he came to a town called <i>Toalli</i>; and from thence forward
there was a difference in the houses. For those which were behind
us were thatched with straw, and those of <i>Toalli</i> were covered with
reeds, in manner of tiles. These houses are very cleanly. Some of
them had walls daubed with clay, which showed like a mud-wall. In
all the cold country the Indians have every one a house for the winter
daubed with clay within and without, and the door is very little; they
shut it by night, and make fire within; so that they are in it as warm
as in a stove, and so it continueth all night that they need not clothes;
and besides these they have others for summer; and their kitchens
near them, where they make fire and bake their bread; and they have
barbacoas wherein they keep their maize; which is a house set up
in the air upon four stakes, boarded about like a chamber, and the
floor of it is of cane hurdles. The difference which lords or principal
men's houses have from the rest, besides they be greater, is, that
they have great galleries in their fronts, and under them seats made
of canes in manner of benches; and round about them they have
many lofts, wherein they lay up that which the Indians do give them
for tribute, which is maize, deers' skins, and mantles of the country,
which are like blankets; they make them of the inner rind of the barks
of trees, and some of a kind of grass like unto nettles, which being<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>
beaten, is like unto flax. The women cover themselves with these
mantles; they put one about them from the waist downward, and
another over their shoulder, with their right arm out, like unto the
Egyptians. The men wear but one mantle upon their shoulders after
the same manner; and have their secrets hid with a deer's skin, made
like a linen breech, which was wont to be used in <i>Spain</i>. The skins
are well curried, and they give them what color they list, so perfect,
that if it be red, it seemeth a very fine cloth in grain, and the black
is most fine, and of the same leather they make shoes; and they dye
their mantles in the same colors. The Governor departed from <i>Toalli</i>
the 24th of March; he came on Thursday at evening to a small
river, where a bridge was made whereon the people passed, and <i>Benit</i>
<i>Fernandez</i>, a Portuguese, fell off from it, and was drowned. As soon
as the Governor had passed the river, a little distance thence he found
a town called <i>Achese</i>. The Indians had no notice of the Christians:
they leaped into a river: some men and women were taken, among
which was one that understood the youth which guided the Governor
to <i>Yupaha</i>; whereby that which he had reported was more confirmed.
For they had passed through countries of divers languages, and some
which he understood not. The Governor sent by one of the Indians
that were taken to call the cacique, which was on the other side of
the river. He came, and made this speech following:</p>

<p>"Right high, right mighty, and excellent lord, those things which
seldom happen do cause admiration. What then may the sight of
your lordship and your people do to me and mine, whom we never
saw? especially being mounted on such fierce beasts as your horses
are, entering with such violence and fury into my country, without
my knowledge of your coming. It was a thing so strange, and caused
such fear and terror in our minds, that it was not in our power to
stay and receive your lordship with the solemnity due to so high and
renowned a prince as your lordship is. And trusting in your greatness
and singular virtues, I do not only hope to be freed from blame,
but also to receive favors; and the first which I demand of your lordship
is, that you will use me, my country, and subjects as your own;
and the second, that you will tell me who you are, and whence you
come, and whither you go, and what you seek, that I the better may
serve you therein."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him, that he thanked him as much for his
offer and good-will as if he had received it, and as if he had offered
him a great treasure; and told him that he was the son of the Sun,
and came from those parts where he dwelt, and traveled through that<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>
country, and sought the greatest lord and richest province that was in
it. The cacique told him that farther forward dwelt a great lord, and
that his dominion was called <i>Ocute</i>. He gave him a guide and an
interpreter for that province. The Governor commanded his Indians
to be set free, and traveled through his country up a river very well
inhabited. He departed from his town the first of April; and left a
very high cross of wood set up in the midst of the market-place;
and because the time gave no more leisure, he declared to him only
that that cross was a memory of the same whereon Christ, which was
God and man, and created the heavens and the earth, suffered for our
salvation; therefore he exhorted them that they should reverence it,
and they made show as though they would do so. The fourth of April
the Governor passed by a town called <i>Altamaca</i>, and the tenth of the
month he came to <i>Ocute</i>. The cacique sent him two thousand Indians
with a present, to wit, many conies and partridges, bread of maize,
two hens, and many dogs; which among the Christians were esteemed
as if they had been fat wethers, because of the great want of flesh
meat and salt, and hereof in many places, and many times was great
need; and they were so scarce, that if a man fell sick, there was
nothing to cherish him withal; and with a sickness, that in another
place easily might have been remedied, he consumed away till nothing
but skin and bones were left; and they died of pure weakness, some
of them saying, "If I had a slice of meat or a few corns of salt, I
should not die. The Indians want no flesh meat; for they kill with
their arrows many deer, hens, conies, and other wild fowl, for they
are very cunning at it, which skill the Christians had not; and
though they had it, they had no leisure to use it; for the most of the
time they spent in travel, and durst not presume to straggle aside.
And because they were thus scanted of flesh, when six hundred men
that went with <i>Soto</i> came to any town, and found thirty or forty
dogs, he that could get one and kill it thought himself no small man;
and he that killed it and gave not his captain one quarter, if he knew
it he frowned on him, and made him feel it in the watches, or in any
other matter of labor that was offered, wherein he might do him a
displeasure. On Monday, the twelfth of April, 1540, the Governor departed
from <i>Ocute</i>. The cacique gave him two hundred <i>Tamenes</i>, to
wit, Indians to carry burdens; he passed through a town, the lord
whereof was named <i>Cofaqui</i>, and came to a province of an Indian
lord called <i>Patofa</i>, who because he was in peace with the lord of
<i>Ocute</i>, and with the other bordering lords, had many days before
notice of the Governor, and desired to see him. He came to visit
him, and made this speech following.<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a></p>

<p>"Mighty lord, now with good reason I will crave of fortune to requite
this my so great prosperity with some small adversity; and I will
count myself very rich, seeing that I have obtained that which in this
world I most desired, which is to see and be able to do your lordship
some service. And although the tongue be the image of that which
is in the heart, and that the contentment which I feel in my heart I
cannot dissemble, yet is it not sufficient wholly to manifest the
same. Where did this your country, which I do govern, deserve to
be visited of so sovereign and so excellent a prince, whom all the rest
of the world ought to obey and serve? And those which inhabit it
being so base, what shall be the issue of such happiness, if their
memory do not represent unto them some adversity that may betide
them, according to the order of fortune? If from this day forward
we may be capable of this benefit, that your lordship will hold us for
your own, we cannot fail to be favored and maintained in true justice
and reason, and to have the name of men. For such as are void of
reason and justice, may be compared to brute beasts. For mine own
part, from my very heart with reverence due to such a prince, I offer
myself unto your lordship, and beseech you, that in reward of this
my true good will, you will vouchsafe to make use of mine own person,
my country, and subjects."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him, that his offers and good-will declared
by the effect, did highly please him, whereof he would always be
mindful to honor and favor him as his brother. This country, from
the first peaceable cacique, unto the province of <i>Patofa</i>, which were
fifty leagues, is a fat country, beautiful, and very fruitful, and very
well watered, and full of good rivers. And from thence to the <i>Port
de Spirito Santo</i>, where we first arrived in the land of <i>Florida</i> (which
may be three hundred and fifty leagues, little more or less), is a barren
land, and the most of it groves of wild pine trees, low and full of
lakes, and in some places very high and thick groves, whither the Indians
that were in arms fled, so that no man could find them, neither
could any horses enter into them, which was an inconvenience to the
Christians, in regard of the victuals which they found conveyed away;
and of the troubles which they had in seeking of Indians to be their
guides.</p>

<p>In the town of <i>Patofa</i> the youth which the Governor carried with
him for an interpreter and a guide, began to foam at the mouth, and
tumble on the ground, as one possessed with the devil: they said a
gospel over him, and the fit left him. And he said, that four days'
journey from thence toward the sun rising, was the province that he<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a>
spoke of. The Indians of <i>Patofa</i> said, that toward that part they
knew no habitation; but that toward the north-west, they knew a
province which was called <i>Coça</i>, a very plentiful country, which had
very great towns in it. The cacique told the Governor that if he would
go thither, he would give him guides and Indians for burdens; and if
he would go whither the youth spake of, that he would likewise give
him those that he needed; and so with loving words and offers of courtesy,
they took their leaves the one of the other. He gave him seven
hundred Indians to bear burdens. He took maize for four days' journey.
He traveled six days by a path which grew narrow more and
more, till it was lost altogether. He went where the youth did lead
him, and passed two rivers, which were waded: each of them was two
crossbow shots over; the water came to the stirrups, and had so great
a current, that it was needful for the horsemen to stand one before
another, that the footmen might pass above them, leaning unto them.
He came to another river of a great current and largeness, which was
passed with more trouble, because the horses did swim at the coming
out, about a lance's length. Having passed this river, the Governor
came to a grove of pine trees, and threatened the youth, and made
as though he would have cast him to the dogs, because he had told
him a lie, saying, it was but four days' journey, and they had traveled
nine, and every day seven or eight leagues, and the men by this time
were grown weary and weak, and the horses lean through the great
scanting of the maize. The youth said that he knew not where he
was. It saved him that he was not cast to the dogs, that there was
never another whom <i>John Ortiz</i> did understand. The Governor, with
them two, and with some horsemen and footmen, leaving the camp in
a grove of pine trees, traveled that day five or six leagues to seek a
way, and returned at night very comfortless, and without finding any
sign of way or town. The next day there were sundry opinions delivered,
whether they should go back, or what they should do; and
because backward the country whereby they had passed was greatly
spoiled, and destitute of maize, and that which they brought with
them was spent, and the men were very weak, and the horses likewise,
they doubted much whether they might come to any place where they
might help themselves. And besides this, they were of opinion, that
going in that sort out of order, that any Indians would presume to set
upon them, so that with hunger or with war, they could not escape.
The Governor determined to send horsemen from thence every way to
seek habitation; and the next day he sent four captains, every one a
<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>sundry way with eight horsemen. At night they came again, leading
their horses, or driving them with a stick before; for they were weary,
that they could not lead them, neither found they any way or sign of
habitation. The next day the Governor sent other four with as many
horsemen that could swim, to pass the swamps and rivers which they
should find, and they had choice horses, the best that were in the
camp. The captains were <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i>, which went up the
river; and <i>John Danusco</i> down the river; <i>Alfonso Romo</i> and <i>John
Rodriguez Lobillo</i> went into the inward parts of the land. The Governor
brought with him into <i>Florida</i> thirteen sows, and had by this
time three hundred swine. He commanded every man should have
half a pound of hog's flesh every day, and this he did three or four
days after the maize was all spent. With this small quantity of flesh,
and some sodden herbs, with much trouble the people were sustained.
The Governor dismissed the Indians of <i>Patofa</i>, because he had no
food to give them; who desiring to accompany and serve the Christians
in their necessity, making show that it grieved them very much
to return until they had left them in a peopled country, returned to
their own home. <i>John Danusco</i> came on Sunday late in the evening,
and brought news that he had found a little town twelve or thirteen
leagues from thence: he brought a woman and a boy that he took there.
With his coming and with those news, the Governor and all the rest were
so glad that they seemed at that instant to have returned from death to
life. Upon Monday, the twenty-sixth of April, the Governor departed
to go to the town, which was called <i>Aymay</i>; and the Christians named
it the town of <i>Relief</i>. He left where the camp had lain at the foot
of a pine tree, a letter buried, and letters carved in the bark of the
pine, the contents whereof was this: Dig here at the foot of this pine,
and you shall find a letter. And this he did, because when the captains
came, which were sent to seek some habitation, they might
see the letter, and know what was become of the Governor, and
which way he was gone. There was no other way to the town, but
the marks that <i>John Danusco</i> left made upon the trees. The Governor,
with some of them that had the best horses, came to it on the Monday;
and all the rest inforcing themselves the best way they could,
some of them lodged within two leagues of the town, some within
three and four, every one as he was able to go, and his strength served
him. There was found in the town a store-house full of the flour
of parched maize; and some maize, which was distributed by allowance.
Here were four Indians taken, and none of them would confess
any other thing, but that they knew of none other habitation.
The Governor commanded one of them to be burned, and presently<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>
another confessed that two days' journey from thence, there was a
province that was called <i>Cutifachiqui</i>. Upon Wednesday came the
captains <i>Baltasar de Gallegos, Alfonso Romo</i>, and <i>John Rodriguez
Lobillo</i>, for they had found the letter, and followed the way which the
Governor had taken toward the town. Two men of <i>John Rodriguez's</i>
company were lost, because their horses tired; the Governor checked
him very sore for leaving them behind, and sent to seek them; and
as soon as they came he departed toward <i>Cutifachiqui</i>. In the way
three Indians were taken, which said that the lady of that country
had notice already of the Christians, and stayed for them in a town
of hers. The Governor sent by one of them to offer her his friendship,
and to advertise her how he was coming thither. The Governor
came unto the town, and presently there came four canoes to him; in
one of them came a sister of the lady, and approaching to the Governor
she said these words:</p>

<p>"Excellent lord, my sister sendeth unto you by me to kiss your
lordship's hands, and to signify unto you that the cause why she came
not in person, is, that she thinketh to do you greater service staying
behind, as she doth, giving order that with all speed all her canoes
be ready, that your lordship may pass the river, and take your rest,
which shall presently be performed."</p>

<p>The Governor gave her thanks, and she returned to the other side
of the river. Within a little while the lady (Cutifachiqui) came out
of the town in a chair, whereon certain of the principal Indians
brought her to the river. She entered into a barge which had the
stern tilted over, and on the floor her mat ready laid with two cushions
upon it one upon another, where she sat her down; and with her
came her principal Indians in other barges, which did wait upon her.
She went to the place where the Governor was, and at her coming she
made this speech following:</p>

<p>"Excellent lord, I wish this coming of your lordship into these
your countries to be most happy; although my power be not answerable
to my will, and my services be not according to my desire, nor
such as so high a prince as your lordship deserveth; yet since the
good-will is rather to be accepted than all the treasures of the world,
that without it are offered with most unfailable and manifest affection,
I offer you my person, lands, and subjects, and this small service."</p>

<p>And therewithal she presented unto him great store of clothes of
the country, which she brought in other canoes, to wit, mantles and
skins; and took from her own neck a great cordon of pearls, and cast
it about the neck of the Governor, entertaining him with very gracious<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a>
speeches of love and courtesy, and commanded canoes to be brought
thither, wherein the Governor and his people passed the river. As
soon as he was lodged in the town, she (Cutifachiqui) sent him another
present of many hens. This country was very pleasant, fat, and
hath goodly meadows by the rivers. Their woods are thin, and full
of walnut trees and mulberry trees. They said the sea was two days'
journey from thence. Within a league and half a league about this
town were great towns dispeopled, and overgrown with grass; which
showed that they had been long without inhabitants. The Indians
said that two years before there was a plague in that country, and that
they removed to other towns. There was in their store-houses great
quantity of clothes, mantles of yarn made of the barks of trees, and
others made of feathers, white, green, red, and yellow, very fine after
their use, and profitable for winter. There were also many deer's
skins, with many compartments traced in them, and some of them
made into hose, stockings, and shoes. And the lady perceiving that
the Christians esteemed the pearls, advised the Governor to send to
search certain graves that were in that town, and that he should find
many; and that if he would send to the dispeopled towns he might load
all his horses. They sought the graves of that town, and there found
fourteen rows of pearls (three hundred and ninety-two pounds), and little
babies and birds made of them. The people were brown, well made,
and well proportioned, and more civil than any others that were seen
in all the country of <i>Florida</i>, and all of them went shod and clothed.
The youth told the Governor that he began now to enter into the
land which he spoke of; and some credit was given him that it was
so, because he understood the language of the Indians; and he requested
that he might be christened, for he said he desired to become
a Christian. He was christened, and named <i>Peter</i>; and the
Governor commanded him to be loosed from a chain, in which until
that time he had gone. This country, as the Indians reported, had
been much inhabited, and had the fame of a good country. And as
it seemeth, the youth, which was the Governor's guide, had heard of
it, and that which he knew by hearsay, he affirmed that he had seen,
and augmented at his pleasure. In this town was found a dagger,
and beads that belonged to Christians. The Indians reported that
Christians had been in the haven (St. Helena), which was two days'
journey from this town, many years ago. He that came thither was
the Governor, the <i>Licentiate Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon</i>, which went to
conquer this country, and at his coming to the port he died (1525);<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>
and there was a division, quarrels and slaughters between some principal
men which went with him, for the principal government. And
without knowing anything of the country, they returned home to <i>Hispaniola</i>.
All the company thought it good to inhabit that country,
because it was in a temperate climate (32° 30'). And that if it were
inhabited, all the ships of New Spain, of <i>Peru</i>, <i>Santa Martha</i>, and
<i>Terra Firma</i>, in their return for <i>Spain</i> might well touch there, because
it was in their way, and because it was a good country, and sited fit
to raise commodity. The Governor, since his intent was to seek another
treasure, like that of <i>Atabalipa</i>, Lord of <i>Peru</i>, was not contented
with a good country, nor with pearls, though many of them were
worth their weight in gold. And if the country had been divided
among the Christians, those which the Indians had fished for afterwards
would have been of more value; for those which they had, because
they burned them in the fire, did lessen their color. The Governor
answered them that urged him to inhabit, that in all the country
there were not victuals to sustain his men one month; and that
it was needful to resort to the Port of <i>Ocus</i>, where <i>Maldonado</i> was
to stay for them: and that if no richer country were found, they
might return again to that whensoever they would; and in the meantime
the Indians would sow their fields, and it would be better furnished
with maize. He inquired of the Indians whether they had
notice of any great lord farther into the land. They told him that
twelve days' journey from thence<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> there was a province called <i>Chiaha</i>,
subject to the Lord of <i>Coça</i>. Presently the Governor determined to
seek that land. And being a stern man, and of few words, though
he was glad to sift and know the opinion of all men, yet after he had
delivered his own, he would not be contraried, and always did what
liked himself, and so all men did condescend unto his will. And
though it seemed an error to leave that country (for others might
have been sought round about, where the people might have been
sustained until the harvest had been ready there, and the maize
gathered), yet there was none that would say anything against him,
after they knew his resolution.</p>

<p>The Governor departed from <i>Cutifachiqui</i> the third day of May.
And because the Indians had revolted, and the will of the lady was
perceived, that if she could, she would depart without giving any
guides or men for burden, for the wrongs which the Christians had
done to the Indians (for there never want some among many of a<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>
base sort, that for a little gain do put themselves and others in danger
of undoing), the Governor commanded her to be kept in safeguard,
and carried with him, not with so good usage as she deserved for the
good-will she showed, and good entertainment that she had made him.
And he verified that old proverb which saith: "For well-doing I receive
evil." And so he carried her on foot with his bondwomen to
look unto her. In all the towns where the Governor passed, the lady
commanded the Indians to come and carry the burdens from one town
to another. We passed through her country an hundred leagues, in
which, as we saw, she was much obeyed, for the Indians did all that she
commanded them with great efficacy and diligence. <i>Peter</i>, the youth
that was our guide, said that she was not the lady herself, but a niece
of hers, which came to that town to execute certain principal men by
commandment of the lady, which had withheld her tribute; which
words were not believed, because of the lies which they had found in
him before; but they bare with all things because of the need which
they had of him to declare what the Indians said. In seven days'
space the Governor came to a province called <i>Ohalaque</i>, the poorest
country of maize that was seen in <i>Florida</i>. The Indians feed upon
roots and herbs, which they seek in the fields, and upon wild beasts,
which they kill with their bows and arrows, and are a very gentle
people. All of them go naked, and are very lean. There was a
Lord (Cutifachiqui), which for a great present, brought the Governor
two deer skins; and there were in that country many wild hens. In one
town they made him a present of seven hundred hens, and so in
other towns they sent him those which they had or could get. From
this province to another, which is called <i>Xualla</i>, he spent five days.
Here he found very little maize, and for this cause, though the people
were wearied, and the horses very weak, he staid no more but two
days. From <i>Ocute</i> to <i>Cutifachiqui</i>, may be some hundred and thirty
leagues, whereof eighty are wilderness. From <i>Cutifachiqui</i> to <i>Xualla</i>
two hundred and fifty, and it is a hilly country. The Governor departed
from <i>Xualla</i> towards <i>Guaxule</i>&mdash;he passed very rough and
high hills. In that journey, the lady of <i>Cutifachiqui</i> (whom the
Governor carried with him, as is aforesaid, with purpose to carry her
to <i>Guaxule</i>, because her territory reached thither), going on a day
with the bondwomen which led her, went out of the way, and entered
into a wood, saying she went to ease herself, and so she deceived
them, and hid herself in the wood; and though they sought her they
<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>could not find her. She carried away with her a little chest made of
canes in manner of a coffer, which they call petaca, full of unbored
pearls. Some which could judge of them, said that they were of
great value. An Indian woman that waited on her did carry them.
The Governor, not to discontent her altogether, left them with her,
making account that in <i>Guaxule</i> he would ask them of her, when he
gave her leave to return; which coffer she carried away and went to
<i>Xualla</i> with three slaves which fled from the camp, and one horseman
which remained behind, who, falling sick of an ague, went out of the
way and was lost. This man, whose name was <i>Alimamos</i>, dealt with
the slaves to change their evil purpose, and return with him to the
Christians, which two of them did; and <i>Alimamos</i> and they overtook
the Governor fifty leagues from thence in a province called
<i>Chiaha</i>; and reported how the lady remained in <i>Xualla</i> with a slave
of <i>Andrew de Vasconcelos</i>, which would not come back with them;
and that of a certainty they lived as man and wife together, and
meant to go both to <i>Cutifachiqui</i>. Within five days the Governor
came to <i>Guaxule</i>. The Indians there gave him a present of three
hundred dogs, because they saw the Christians esteem them, and
sought them to feed on them; for among them they are not eaten.
In <i>Guaxule</i>, and all that way, was very little maize. The Governor
sent from thence an Indian with a message to the cacique of <i>Chiaha</i>,
to desire him to gather some maize thither, that he might rest a few
days in <i>Chiaha</i>. The Governor departed from <i>Guaxule</i>, and in two
days' journey came to a town called <i>Canasagua</i>. There met him on
the way twenty Indians, every one loaded with a basketful of mulberries;
for there be many, and those very good, from <i>Cutifachiqui</i>
thither, and so forward in other provinces, and also nuts and plums.
And the trees grow in the fields without planting or dressing them,
and as big and as rank as though they grew in gardens digged and
watered. From the time that the Governor departed from <i>Canasagua</i>,
he journeyed five days through a desert; and two leagues before he
came to <i>Chiaha</i>, there met him fifteen Indians loaded with maize,
which the cacique had sent; and they told him on his behalf, that he
waited his coming with twenty barns full of it; and further, that
himself, his country, and subjects, and all things else were at his service.
On the fifth day of June, the Governor entered into <i>Chiaha</i>.
The cacique voided his own houses, in which he lodged, and received
him with much joy, saying these words following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mighty and excellent lord, I hold myself for so happy a man, in
that it hath pleased your lordship to use me, that nothing could have<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>
happened unto me of more contentment, nor that I would have esteemed
so much. From <i>Guaxule</i> your lordship sent unto me, that I
should prepare maize for you in this town for two months. Here I
have for you twenty barns full of the choicest that in all the country
could be found. If your lordship be not entertained by me in such
sort as is fit for so high a prince, respect my tender age, which excuseth
me from blame, and receive my good-will, which with much
loyalty, truth and sincerity, I will always show in anything which
shall concern your lordship's service."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him that he thanked him very much for his
service and offer, and that he would always account him as his
brother. There was in this town much butter in gourds melted like
oil&mdash;they said it was the fat of bears. There was found, also, great
store of oil of walnuts, which was clear as butter, and of a good
taste, and a pot full of honey of bees, which neither before nor afterward
was seen in all the country. The town was an island between
two arms of a river, and was seated nigh one of them. The river
divideth itself into those two branches, two crossbow shots above the
town, and meeteth again a league beneath the same. The plain between
both the branches is sometimes one crossbow shot, sometimes
two crossbow shots over. The branches are very broad, and both of
them may be waded over. There were along them very good meadows,
and many fields sown with maize. And because the Indians
staid in their town, the Governor only lodged in the houses of the
cacique, and his people in the fields; where there was ever a tree every
one took one for himself. Thus the camp lay separated one from
another, and out of order. The Governor winked at it, because the
Indians were in peace, and because it was very hot, and the people
should have suffered great extremity if it had not been so. The
horses came thither so weak, that for feebleness they were not able to
carry their masters; because that from <i>Cutifachiqui</i> they always
traveled with very little provender, and were hunger-starved and tired
ever since they came from the desert of <i>Ocute</i>. And because the
most of them were not in case to use in battle, though need should
require, they sent them to feed in the night a quarter of a league
from the camp. The Christians were there in great danger, because
that if at this time the Indians had set upon them, they had been in
evil case to have defended themselves. The Governor rested there
thirty days, in which time, because the country was very fruitful, the
horses grew fat. At the time of his departure, by the importunity of<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a>
some, which would have more than was reason, he demanded of the
cacique thirty women to make slaves of. He answered that he would
confer with his chief men. And before he returned an answer, one
night all of them with their wives and children forsook the town, and
fled away. The next day, the Governor proposing to go to seek
them, the cacique came unto him, and at his coming used these words
unto the Governor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mighty lord, with shame and fear of your lordship, because my
subjects against my will have done amiss in absenting themselves, I
went my way without your license; and knowing the error which I
have committed, like a loyal subject, I come to yield myself into your
power, to dispose of me at your own pleasure. For my subjects do
not obey me, nor do anything but what an uncle of mine commandeth,
which governeth this country for me, until I be of a perfect age. If
your lordship will pursue them, and execute on them that, which for
their disobedience they deserve, I will be your guide, since at this
present my fortune will not suffer me to perform any more."</p>

<p>Presently, the Governor with thirty horsemen, and as many footmen,
went to seek the Indians, and passing by some towns of the principal
Indians which had absented themselves, he cut and destroyed great
fields of maize; and went up the river, where the Indians were in an
island, where the horsemen could not come at them. There he sent
them word by an Indian to return to their town and fear nothing,
and that they should give his men to carry burdens, as all those
behind had done; for he would have no Indian women, seeing they
were so loth to part with them. The Indians accepted his request,
and came to the Governor to excuse themselves; and so all of them
returned to their town. A cacique of a province called <i>Coste</i>, came
to this town to visit the Governor. After he had offered himself, and
passed with him some words of tendering his service and courtesy, the
Governor asking him whether he had notice of any rich country? he
said yea: to wit, that toward the north there was a province named
<i>Chisca</i>:<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and that there was a melting of copper, and of another
metal of the same color, save that it was finer, and of a far more perfect
color, and far better to the sight; and that they used it not so
much, because it was softer. And the self same thing was told the
Governor in <i>Cutifachiqui</i>, where we saw some little hatchets of copper,
which were said to have a mixture of gold. But in that part<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>
the country was not well peopled, and they said there were mountains,
which the horses could not pass: and for that cause, the Governor
would not go from <i>Cutifachiqui</i> directly thither: and he made account,
that traveling through a peopled country, when his men and
horses should be in better plight, and he were better certified of the
truth of the thing, he would return toward it, by mountains, and a
better inhabited country, whereby he might have better passage. He
sent two Christians from <i>Chiaha</i> with certain Indians which knew
the country of <i>Chisca</i>, and the language thereof, to view it, and to
make report of that which they should find; where he told them that
he would tarry for them.</p>

<p>When the Governor was determined to depart from <i>Chiaha</i> to <i>Coste</i>,
he sent for the cacique to come before him, and with gentle words
took his leave of him, and gave him certain things, wherewith he
rested much contented. In seven days he came to <i>Coste</i>. The second
of July he commanded his camp to be pitched two crossbow shots from
the town: and with eight men of his guard he went where he found
the cacique, which to his thinking received him with great love. As
he was talking with him, there went from the camp certain footmen
to the town to seek some maize, and not contented with it, they ransacked
and searched the houses, and took what they found. With
this despite, the Indians began to rise and to take their arms: and
some of them, with cudgels in their hands, ran upon five or six Christians,
which had done them wrong, and beat them at their pleasure.
The Governor seeing them all in an uproar, and himself among them
with so few Christians, to escape their hands used a stratagem, far
against his own disposition, being, as he was, very frank and open:
and though it grieved him very much that any Indian should be so
bold, as with reason, or without reason to despise the Christians, he
took up a cudgel, and took their parts against his own men; which
was a means to quiet them. And presently he sent word by a man
very secretly to the camp, that some armed men should come toward
the place where he was; and he took the cacique by the hand, using
very mild words unto him, and with some principal Indians that did
accompany him, he drew them out of the town into a plain way, and
unto the sight of the camp, whither by little and little with good discretion
the Christians began to come and to gather about them. Thus
the Governor led the cacique and his chief men until he entered with
them into the camp: and near unto his tent he commanded them to
be put in safe custody; and told them that they should not depart<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>
without giving him a guide and Indians for burdens, and till certain
sick Christians were come, which he had commanded to come down
the river in canoes from <i>Chiaha</i>; and those also which he had sent
to the province of <i>Chisca</i>: (for they were not returned; and he
feared that the Indians had slain the one, and the other.) Within
three days after, those which were sent to <i>Chisca</i> returned, and made
report that the Indians had carried them through a country so poor
of maize, and so rough, and over so high mountains, that it was impossible
for the army to travel that way; and that seeing the way
grew very long, and that they lingered much, they consulted to return
from a little poor town, where they saw nothing that was of any profit,
and brought an ox hide, which the Indians gave them, as thin as a
calf's skin, and the hair like a soft wool, between the coarse and fine
wool of sheep. The cacique gave a guide, and men for burdens, and
departed with the Governor's leave. The Governor departed from
<i>Coste</i> the ninth of July, and lodged at a town called <i>Tali</i>. The cacique
came forth to receive him on the way, and made this speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excellent lord and prince, worthy to be served and obeyed of all
the princes in the world; howsoever for the most part by the outward
physiognomy the inward virtue may be judged, and that who you
are, and of what strength, was known unto me before now: I will not
infer hereupon how mean I am in your presence, to hope that my
poor services will be grateful and acceptable: since whereas strength
faileth, the will doth not cease to be praised and accepted. And for
this cause I presume to request your lordship, that you will be pleased
only to respect the same, and consider wherein you will command my
service in this your country."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him, that his good-will and offer was as
acceptable unto him as if he had offered him all the treasures of the
world, and that he would always entreat, favor, and esteem him as if
he were his own brother. The cacique commanded provision necessary
for two days, while the Governor was there, to be brought thither:
and at the time of his departure, he gave him four women and two
men, which he had need of to bear burdens. The Governor traveled
six days through many towns subject to the cacique of <i>Coça</i>: and as
he entered into his country many Indians came unto him every day
from the cacique, and met him on the way with messages, one going,
and another coming. He came to <i>Coça</i> upon Friday, the 26th of
July. The cacique came forth to receive him two crossbow shots from
the town in a chair, which his principal men carried on their shoulders,<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>
sitting upon a cushion, and covered with a garment of marterns,
of the fashion and bigness of a woman's huke: he had on his head a
diadem of feathers, and round about him many Indians playing upon
flutes, and singing. As soon as he came unto the Governor, he did his
obeyance, and uttered these words following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excellent and mighty lord, above all them of the earth, although
I come but now to receive you, yet I have received you many
days ago in my heart, to wit, from the day wherein I had first notice
of your lordship: with so great desire to serve you, with so great
pleasure and contentment, that this which I make show of, is nothing
in regard of that which is in my heart, neither can it have any kind
of comparison. This you may hold for certain, that to obtain the
dominion of the whole world, would not have rejoiced me so much as
your sight, neither would I have held it for so great a felicity. Do
not look for me to offer you that which is your own, to wit, my person,
my lands, and subjects; only I will busy myself in commanding
my men with all diligence and due reverence to welcome you from
hence to the town with playing and singing, where your lordship
shall be lodged and attended upon by myself and them; and all that
I possess your lordship shall use as it were your own. For your
lordship shall do me a very great favor in so doing."</p>

<p>The Governor gave him thanks, and with great joy they both went
conferring together till they came to the town; and he commanded his
Indians to void their houses, wherein the Governor and his men were
lodged. There was in the barns and in the fields great store of maize
and French beans. The country was greatly inhabited with many
great towns, and many sown fields, which reached from the one to the
other. It was pleasant, fat, full of good meadows upon rivers. There
were in the fields many plum trees, as well of such as grow in <i>Spain</i>
as of the country; and wild tall vines, that run up the trees; and
besides these there were other low vines with big and sweet grapes;
but for want of digging and dressing, they had great kernels in them.
The Governor used to set a guard over the caciques, because they
should not absent themselves, and carried them with him till he came
out of their countries; because that carrying them along with him,
he looked to find people in the towns, and they gave him guides, and
men to carry burdens; and before he went out of their countries, he
gave them license to return to their houses, and to their porters likewise,
as soon as he came to any other lordship where they gave him
others. The men of <i>Coça</i> seeing their lord detained, took it in evil<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>
part, and revolted, and hid themselves in the woods, as well those
of the town of the cacique, as those of the other towns of his principal
subjects. The Governor sent out four captains, every one his way,
to seek them. They took many men and women, which were put into
chains. They seeing the hurt which they received, and how little
they gained in absenting themselves, came again, promising to do
whatsoever they were commanded. Of those which were taken
prisoners, some principal men were set at liberty, whom the cacique
demanded; and every one that had any, carried the rest in chains like
slaves, without letting them go to their country. Neither did any return,
but some few, whose fortune helped them with the good diligence
which they used to file off their chains by night, or such as in
their traveling could slip aside out of the way, seeing any negligence
in them that kept them; some escaped away with the chains, and
with the burdens and clothes which they carried.</p>

<p>The Governor rested in <i>Coça</i> twenty-five days. He departed from
thence the twentieth of August, to seek a province called <i>Tascaluca</i>;
he carried with him the cacique of <i>Coça</i>. He passed that day by a
great town called <i>Tallimuchase</i>; the people were fled; he lodged half
a league further, near a brook. The next day he came to a town called
<i>Ytaua</i>, subject to <i>Coça</i>. He staid there six days, because of a river
that passed by it, which at that time was very high; and as soon as
the river suffered him to pass, he set forward, and lodged at a town
named <i>Ullibahali</i>. There came to him on the way, of the caciques in
behalf of that province, ten or twelve principal Indians to offer him
their service; all of them had their plumes of feathers, and bows and
arrows. The Governor coming to the town with twelve horsemen,
and some footmen of his guard, leaving his people a crossbow shot
from the town, entered into it; he found all the Indians with their
weapons, and as far as he could guess, they seemed to have some evil
meaning. It was known afterwards that they were determined to
take the cacique of <i>Coça</i> from the Governor, if he had requested it.
The Governor commanded all his people to enter the town, which was
walled about, and near unto it passed a small river. The wall, as
well of that as of others, which afterwards we saw, was of great posts
thrust deep into the ground, and very rough; and many long rails, as
big as one's arm, laid across between them, and the wall was about the
height of a lance, and it was daubed within and without with clay,
and had loopholes. On the other side of the river was a town,
where at that present the cacique was. The Governor sent to call him,<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>
and he came presently. After he had passed with the Governor some
words of offering his services, he gave him such men for his carriages
as he needed, and thirty women for slaves. In that place was a
Christian lost, called <i>Mançano</i>, born in <i>Salamanca</i>, of noble parentage,
which went astray to seek for grapes, whereof there is great
store, and those very good. The day that the Governor departed from
thence, he lodged at a town, subject to the lord of <i>Ullibahali</i>; and
the next day he came to another town called <i>Toasi</i>. The Indians
gave the Governor thirty women, and such men for his carriages
as he needed. He traveled ordinarily five or six leagues a day, when
he traveled through peopled countries; and going through deserts, he
marched as fast as he could, to eschew the want of maize. From
<i>Toasi</i>, passing through some towns subject to a cacique, which was
lord of a province called <i>Tallise</i>, he traveled five days. He came to
<i>Tallise</i> the 18th of September. The town was great, and situated
near unto a main river. On the other side of the river were other
towns, and many fields sown with maize. On both sides it was a very
plentiful country, and had store of maize; they had voided the town.
The Governor commanded to call the cacique; who came, and between
them passed some words of love and offer of his services, and he presented
unto him forty Indians. There came to the Governor in this
town, a principal Indian in the behalf of the cacique of <i>Tascaluca</i>,
and made this speech following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mighty, virtuous, and esteemed lord, the great cacique of <i>Tascaluca</i>,
my lord, sendeth by me to kiss your lordship's hands, and to let
you understand that he hath notice how you justly ravish with your
perfections and power, all men on the earth and that every one by
whom your lordship passeth, doth serve and obey you, which he acknowledgeth
to be due unto you, and desireth, as his life, to see and
to serve your lordship. For which cause by me he offereth himself,
his lands and subjects, that when your lordship pleaseth to go through
his country, you may be received with all peace and love, served and
obeyed; and that in recompense of the desire he hath to see you, you
will do him the favor to let him know when you will come; for how
much the sooner, so much the greater favor he shall receive."</p>

<p>The Governor received and dispatched him graciously, giving him
beads, which among them were not much esteemed, and some other
things to carry to his lord. And he gave license to the Cacique of
<i>Coça</i> to return home to his own country. The Cacique of <i>Tallise</i>
gave him such men for burdens as he needed. And after he had<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>
rested there twenty days, he departed thence towards <i>Tascaluca</i>.
That day when he went from <i>Tallise</i>, he lodged at a great town called
<i>Casiste</i>. And the next day passed by another, and came to a small
town of <i>Tascaluca</i>; and the next day he camped in a wood, two
leagues from the town where the cacique resided, and was at that
time. And he sent the master of the camp, <i>Luys de Moscoso</i>, with
fifteen horsemen, to let him know he was coming. The cacique was
in his lodgings under a canopy; and without doors, right against his
lodgings, in a high place, they spread a mat for him, and two cushions
one upon another, where he sat him down, and his Indians placed
themselves round about him, somewhat distant from him, so that they
made a place, and a void room where he sat; and his chiefest men
were nearest to him, and one with a shadow of deer skin, which kept
the sun from him, being round and of the bigness of a target, quartered
with black and white, having a rundle in the midst; afar off it
seemed to be of taffeta, because the colors were very perfect. It was
set on a small staff stretched wide out. This was the device which
he carried in his wars. He was a man of a very tall stature, of
great limbs, and spare, and well proportioned, and was much feared
of his neighbors and subjects. He was lord of many territories and
much people. In his countenance he was very grave. After the
master of the camp had spoken with him, he and those that went
with him coursed their horses, prancing them to and fro, and now and
then towards the place where the cacique was, who, with much gravity
and dissimulation now and then lifted up his eyes, and beheld them, as
it were, with disdain. At the Governor's coming, he made no offer at
all to rise. The Governor took him by the hand, and both of them
sat down together on a seat which was under the cloth of state. The
cacique said these words unto him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mighty lord, I bid your lordship right heartily welcome. I receive
as much pleasure and contentment with your sight, as if you
were my brother, whom I dearly loved; upon this point it is not needful
to use many reasons; since it is no discretion to speak that in
many words, which in few may be uttered. How much the greater
the will is, so much more giveth it name to the works, and the
works give testimony of the truth. Now touching my will, by it you
shall know how certain and manifest it is, and how pure inclination
I have to serve you. Concerning the favor which you did me, in the
things which you sent me, I make as much account of them as is
reason to esteem them, and chiefly because they were yours. Now
see what service you will command me."<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a></p>

<p>The Governor satisfied him with sweet words and with great brevity.
When he departed from thence he determined to carry him along
with him for some cause, and at two days' journey he came to a
town called <i>Piache</i>, by which there passed a great river. The Governor
demanded canoes of the Indians; they said they had them not, but
that they would make rafts of canes and dry timber, on which he
might pass well enough. And they made them with all diligence
and speed, and they governed them; and because the water went very
slow, the Governor and his people passed very well.</p>

<p>From the <i>Port de Spirito Santo</i> to <i>Apalache</i>, which is about an
hundred leagues, the Governor went from east to west; and from
<i>Apalache</i> to <i>Cutifachiqui</i>, which are four hundred and thirty leagues
from the south-west to the north-east; and from <i>Cutifachiqui</i> to
<i>Xualla</i>, which are about two hundred and fifty leagues from the south
to the north; and from <i>Xualla</i> to <i>Tascaluca</i>, which are two hundred
and fifty leagues more, an hundred and ninety of them he traveled
from east to west, to wit, to the province of <i>Coça</i>, and the other sixty
from <i>Coça</i> to <i>Tascaluca</i> from the north to the south.</p>

<p>Having passed the river of <i>Piache</i>, a Christian went from his company
from thence to seek a woman slave that was run away from him,
and the Indians either took him captive, or slew him. The Governor
urged the cacique that he should give account of him, and threatened
him that if he were not found he would never let him loose. The
cacique sent an Indian from thence to <i>Mavilla</i>, whither they were
traveling, which was a town of a principal Indian and his subject,
saying that he sent him to advise them to make ready victuals, and
men for carriages. But (as afterwards appeared) he sent him to
assemble all the men of war thither that he had in his country.
The Governor traveled three days, and the third day he passed all
day through a peopled country, and he came to <i>Mavilla</i> upon Monday
the 18th of October, 1540. He went before the camp with fifteen
horsemen and thirty footmen. And from the town came a Christian,
whom he had sent to the principal man, three or four days before,
because he should not absent himself, and also to learn in what sort
the Indians were; who told him that he thought they were in an evil
purpose; for while he was there, there came many people into the
town, and many weapons, and that they made great haste to fortify
the walls. <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> told the Governor that it would be good
to lodge in the field, seeing the Indians were of such disposition; and
he answered, that he would lodge in the town, for he was weary of<a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>
lodging in the field. When he came near unto the town, the cacique
came forth to receive him with many Indians playing upon flutes and
singing. And after he had offered himself, he presented him with
three mantles of marterns. The Governor, with both the caciques,
and seven or eight men of his guard, and three or four horsemen,
which alighted to accompany him, entered into the town, and sat him
down under a cloth of state. The cacique of <i>Tascaluca</i> requested
him that he would let him remain in that town, and trouble him no
more with traveling. And seeing he would not give him leave, in
his talk he changed his purpose, and dissemblingly feigned that he
would speak with some principal Indians, and rose up from the place
where he sat with the Governor, and entered into a house, where
many Indians were with their bows and arrows. The Governor when
he saw he returned not, called him, and he answered that he would
not come out from thence, neither would he go any farther than that
town, and that if he would go his way in peace, he should presently
depart, and should not seek to carry him perforce out of his country
and territory.</p>

<p>The Governor seeing the determination and furious answer of the
cacique, went about to pacify him with fair words; to which he gave
no answer, but rather with much pride and disdain, withdrew himself
where the Governor might not see him nor speak with him. As a
principal Indian passed that way, the Governor called him, to send
him word that he might remain at his pleasure in his country, and
that it would please him to give him a guide, and men for carriages,
to see if he could pacify him with mild words. The Indians answered
with great pride, that he would not hearken unto him. <i>Baltasar
de Gallegos</i>, which stood by, took hold of a gown of marterns
which he had on, and he cast it over his head, and left it in his
hands: and because all of them immediately began to stir, <i>Baltasar
de Gallegos</i> gave him such a wound with his cutlass, that he opened
him down the back, and presently all the Indians with a great cry
came out of the houses shooting their arrows. The Governor considering
that if he tarried there, he could not escape, and if he commanded
his men to come in, which were without the town, the Indians
within the houses might kill their horses, and do much hurt,
ran out of the town, and before he came out, he fell twice or thrice,
and those that were with him did help him up again; and he and
those that were with him were sore wounded; and in a moment
there were five Christians slain in the town. The Governor came<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a>
running out of the town, crying out that every man should stand
farther off, because from the wall they did them much hurt. The
Indians seeing that the Christians retired, and some of them, or the
most part, more than an ordinary pace, shot with great boldness at
them, and struck down such as they could overtake. The Indians
which the Christians did lead with them in chains, had laid down
their burdens near unto the walls; and as soon as the Governor and
his men were retired, the men of <i>Mavilla</i> laid them on the Indians'
backs again, and took them into the town, and loosed them presently
from their chains, and gave them bows and arrows to fight withal.
Thus they possessed themselves of all the clothes and pearls, and all
that the Christians had, which their slaves carried. And because the
Indians had been always peaceable until we came to this place, some
of our men had their weapons in their fardels, and remained unarmed.
And from others that had entered the town with the Governor they
had taken swords and halberds, and fought with them. When the
Governor was gotten into the field, he called for a horse, and with
some that accompanied him, he returned and slew two or three Indians.
All the rest retired themselves to the town, and shot with their
bows from the wall. And those which presumed of their nimbleness,
sallied forth to fight a stone's cast from the wall. And when the
Christians charged them, they retired themselves at their leisure into
the town. At the time that the broil began, there were in the town a
friar and a priest, and a servant of the Governor, with a woman slave;
and they had no time to come out of the town, and they took a
house, and so remained in the town. The Indians being become
masters of the place, they shut the door with a field gate; and among
them was one sword which the Governor's servant had, and with it
he set himself behind the door, thrusting at the Indians which sought
to come into them; and the friar and the priest stood on the other
side, each of them with a bar in their hands to beat him down that
first came in. The Indians seeing they could not get in by the door,
began to uncover the house top. By this time all the horsemen and
footmen which were behind, were come to <i>Mavilla</i>. Here there were
sundry opinions, whether they should charge the Indians to enter the
town, or whether they should leave it, because it was hard to enter;
and in the end it was resolved to set upon them.</p>

<p>As soon as the battle and the rereward were come to <i>Mavilla</i>, the
Governor commanded all those that were best armed to alight, and
made four squadrons of footmen. The Indians, seeing how he was<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a>
setting his men in order, concluded with the cacique, that he should
go his way, saying unto him, as after it was known by certain women
that were taken there, that he was but one man, and could fight but
for one man, and that they had there among them many principal
Indians, very valiant and expert in feats of arms, that any one of them
was able to order the people there; and forasmuch as matters of war
were subject to casualty, and it was uncertain which part should overcome,
they wished him to save himself, to the end, that if it fell out that
they should end their days there, as they determined rather than to
be overcome, there might remain one to govern the country. For all
this he would not have gone away; but they urged him so much, that
with fifteen or twenty Indians of his own, he went out of the town,
and carried away a scarlet cloak, and other things of the Christians'
goods, as much as he was able to carry, and seemed best unto him.
The Governor was informed how there went men out of the town, and
he commanded the horsemen to beset it, and sent in every squadron
of footmen one soldier with a firebrand to set fire on the houses, that
the Indians might have no defence; all his men being set in order,
he commanded an arquebuss to be shot off. The sign being given,
the four squadrons, every one by itself with great fury, gave the onset,
and with great hurt on both sides they entered the town. The
friar and the priest, and those that were with them in the house were
saved, which cost the lives of two men of account, and valiant, which
came thither to succor them. The Indians fought with such courage,
that many times they drove our men out of the town. The fight
lasted so long, that for weariness and great thirst many of the Christians
went to a pool that was near the wall, to drink, which was all stained
with the blood of the dead, and then came again to fight. The Governor
seeing this, entered among the footmen into the town on horseback,
with certain that accompanied them, and was a mean that the
Christians came to set fire on the houses, and broke and overcame the
Indians, who running out of the town from the footmen, the horsemen
without drove in at the gates again, where being without all
hope of life, they fought valiantly, and after the Christians came
among them to handy blows, seeing themselves in great distress, without
any succor, many of them fled into the burning houses, where
one upon another they were smothered and burnt in the fire. The
whole number of the Indians that died in this town, were two thousand
and five hundred, little more or less. Of the Christians there died
eighteen; of which one was <i>Don Carlos</i>, brother-in-law to the Governor,<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>
and a nephew of his, and one <i>John de Gamez</i>, and <i>Men Rodriguez</i>,
Portuguese, and <i>John Vasquez de Villanova de Barca Rota</i>,
all men of honor, and of much valor; the rest were footmen. Besides
those that were slain, there were a hundred and fifty wounded,
with seven hundred wounds of their arrows: and it pleased God that
of very dangerous wounds they were quickly healed. Moreover there
were twelve horses slain, and seventy hurt. All the clothes which
the Christians carried with them to clothe themselves withal, and the
ornaments to say mass, and the pearls, were all burnt there; and the
Christians did set them on fire themselves; because they held for a
greater inconvenience, the hurt which the Indians might do them
from those houses, where they had gathered all those goods together,
than the loss of them. Here the Governor understood that <i>Francisco
Maldonado</i> waited for him at the Port of <i>Ochuse</i>, and that it
was six days' journey from thence (<i>Mavilla</i>), and he dealt with <i>John
Ortiz</i> to keep it secret, because he had not accomplished that which
he determined to do; and because the pearls were burnt there, which
he meant to have sent to <i>Cuba</i> for a show, that the people hearing
the news, might be desirous to come to that country. He feared also,
that if they should have news of him without seeing from <i>Florida</i>
neither gold nor silver, nor anything of value, it would get such a
name, that no man would seek to go thither, when he should have
need of people. And so he determined to send no news of himself
until he had found some rich country.</p>

<p>From the time that the Governor entered into <i>Florida</i>, until his departure
from <i>Mavilla</i>, there died a hundred and two Christians, some
of sickness, and others which the Indians slew. He stayed in <i>Mavilla</i>,
because of the wounded men, eight-and-twenty days; all which time
he lay in the field. It was a well inhabited and a fat country, there
were some great and walled towns, and many houses scattered all
about the fields, to wit, a crossbow shot or two, the one from the
other. Upon Sunday, the eighteenth of November (1540), when
the hurt men were known to be healed, the Governor departed from
<i>Mavilla</i>. Every one furnished himself with maize for two days, and
they traveled five days through a desert: they came to a province
called <i>Pafallaya</i>, unto a town named <i>Taliepatava</i>: and from thence
they went to another, called <i>Cabusto</i>: near unto it ran a great river.
The Indians on the other side cried out, threatening the Christians to
kill them, if they sought to pass it. The Governor commanded his
men to make a barge within the town, because the Indians should not<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>
perceive it: it was finished in four days, and being ended, he commanded
it to be carried one night upon sleds half a league up the
river. In the morning there entered into it thirteen men well armed.
The Indians perceived what was attempted, and those which were
nearest, came to defend the passage. They resisted what they could,
till the Christians came near them; and seeing that the barge came
to the shore, they fled away into the groves of canes. The Christians
mounted on horseback, and went up the river to make good the passage,
whereby the Governor and his company passed the river. There
were along the river some towns well stored with maize and French
beans. From thence to <i>Chicaça</i> the Governor traveled five days
through a desert. He came to a river, where on the other side were
Indians to defend the passage. He made another barge in two days;
and when it was finished, the Governor sent an Indian to request the
cacique to accept of his friendship, and peaceably to expect his coming:
whom the Indians that were on the other side the river slew before
his face, and presently making a great shout went their way. Having
passed the river, the next day, being the 17th of December, the
Governor came to <i>Chicaça</i>, a small town of twenty houses. And
after they were come to <i>Chicaça</i>, they were much troubled with cold,
because it was now winter and it snowed, while most of them were
lodged in the field, before they had time to make themselves houses.
This country was very well peopled, and the houses scattered like
those of <i>Mavilla</i>, fat and plentiful of maize, and the most part of it
was fielding: they gathered as much as sufficed to pass the winter.
Some Indians were taken, among which was one whom the cacique
esteemed greatly. The Governor sent an Indian to signify to the
cacique that he desired to see him and to have his friendship. The
cacique came unto him, to offer him his person, country and subjects,
and told him that he would cause two other caciques to come to him
in peace; who within a few days after came with him and with their
Indians. The one was called <i>Alimamu</i>, the other <i>Nicalasa</i>. They
gave a present unto the Governor of a hundred and fifty coneys, and of
the country garments, to wit, of mantles and skins. The Cacique of
<i>Chicaça</i> came to visit him many times; and sometimes the Governor
sent to call him, and sent him a horse to go and come. He complained
unto him that a subject of his was risen against him and
deprived him of his tribute, requesting his aid against him, for he
meant to seek him in his country, and to punish him according to his
<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a>desert. Which was nothing else but a feigned plot. For they determined,
as soon as the Governor was gone with him, and the camp
was divided into two parts, the one part of them to set upon the Governor
and the other upon them that remained in <i>Chicaça</i>. He
went to the town where he used to keep his residence, and brought
with him two hundred Indians with their bows and arrows. The
Governor took thirty horsemen and eighty footmen, and they went
to <i>Saquechuma</i> (for so was the province called of that chief man,
which he said had rebelled). They found a walled town, without any
men: and those which went with the cacique set fire on the houses,
to dissemble their treason. But by reason of the great care and
heedfulness, that was as well in the Governor's people which he carried
with him, as of those which remained in <i>Chicaça</i>, they dare not
assault them at that time. The Governor invited the cacique, and
certain principal Indians, and gave them hog's flesh to eat. And
though they did not commonly use it, yet they were so greedy of it,
that every night there came Indians to certain houses a crossbow shot
from the camp, where the hogs lay, and killed, and carried away as
many as they could. And three Indians were taken in the manner.
Two of them the Governor commanded to be shot to death with
arrows; and to cut off the hands of the other; and he sent him so
handled to the cacique. Who made as though it grieved him; yet
they had offended the Governor, and that he was glad that he had
executed that punishment on them. He lay in a plain country, half
a league from the place where the Christians lodged. Four horsemen
went a straggling thither, to wit, <i>Francisco Osorio</i>, and a servant of
the Marquis of <i>Astorga</i>, called <i>Reynoso</i>, and two servants of the Governor,
the one his page, called <i>Ribera</i>, and the other <i>Fuentes</i>, his
chamberlain: and these had taken from the Indians some skins, and
some mantles, wherewith they were offended, and forsook their houses.
The Governor knew of it, and commanded them to be apprehended;
and condemned to death <i>Francisco Osorio</i>, and the chamberlain as
principals, and all of them to loss of goods. The friars and priests
and other principal persons were earnest with him to pardon <i>Francisco
Osorio</i> his life, and to moderate his sentence, which he would not
grant for any of them. While he was ready to command them to
be drawn to the market-place to cut off their heads, there came certain
Indians from the cacique to complain of them. <i>John Ortiz</i>, at
the request of <i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i> and other persons, changed their
words, and told the Governor, that the cacique said, he had notice how
his lordship held those Christians in prison for his sake, and that they<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a>
were in no fault, neither had they done him any wrong, and that if
he would do him any favor, he should set them free. And he told
the Indians, that the Governor said he had them in prison, and that
he would punish them in such sort, that they should be an example
to others. Hereupon the Governor commanded the prisoners to be
loosed. As soon as March was come, he determined to depart from
<i>Chicaça</i>, and demanded of the cacique two hundred men for carriages.
He sent him answer that he would speak with his principal men.
Upon Tuesday, the eighth of March, 1541, the Governor went to the
town where he was, to ask him for the men: he told him he would
send them the next day. As soon as the Governor was come to
<i>Chicaça</i>, he told <i>Luys de Moscoso</i>, the camp-master, that he misliked
the Indians, and that he should keep a strong watch that night, which
he remembered but a little. The Indians came at the second watch
in four squadrons, every one by itself, and as soon as they were descried,
they sounded a drum, and gave the assault with a great cry,
and with so great celerity, that presently they entered with the scouts,
that were somewhat distant from the camp. And when they were
perceived of them which were in the town, half the houses were on
fire, which they had kindled. That night three horsemen chanced to
be scouts; two of them were of base calling, and the worst men in all
the camp, and the other, which was a nephew of the Governor, which
until then was held for a tall man, showed himself there as great a
coward as any of them: for all of them ran away. And the Indians
without any resistance came and set the town on fire; and tarried
without behind the doors for the Christians, which ran out of the
houses, not having any leisure to arm themselves; and as they ran
hither and thither amazed with the noise, and blinded with the smoke
and flame of the fire, they knew not which way they went, neither
could they light upon their weapons, nor saddle their horses, neither
saw they the Indians that shot at them. Many of the horses were
burned in the stables, and those which could break their halters got
loose. The disorder and flight was such that every man fled which
way he could, without leaving any to resist the Indians. But God
(which chastiseth his according to his pleasure, and in the greatest
necessities and dangers sustaineth them with his hand) so blinded
the Indians, that they saw not what they had done, and thought that
the horses which ran loose, were men on horseback, that gathered
themselves together to set upon them. The Governor only rode on
horseback, and with him a soldier called <i>Tapia</i>, and set upon the<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>
Indians, and striking the first he met with his lance, the saddle fell
with him, which with haste was evil girded, and so he fell from his
horse. And all the people that were on foot were fled to a wood out
of the town, and there assembled themselves together. And because
it was night, and that the Indians thought the horses were men on
horseback which came to set upon them, as I said before, they fled;
and one only remained dead, and that was he whom the Governor
slew with his lance. The town lay all burnt to ashes. There was a
woman burned, who, after she and her husband were both gone out
of their house, went in again for certain pearls which they had forgotten,
and when she would have come out, the fire was so great at the
door that she could not, neither could her husband succor her. Other
three Christians came out of their lodgings so cruelly burned, that one
of them died within three days, and the other two were carried many
days each of them upon a couch between staves, which the Indians
carried on their shoulders, for otherwise they could not travel. There
died in this hurlyburly eleven Christians, and fifty horses; and there
remained a hundred hogs, and four hundred were burned. If any
perchance had saved any clothes from the fire of <i>Mavilla</i>, here they
were burned, and many were clad in skins, for they had no leisure to
take their coats. They endured much cold in this place, and the
chiefest remedy were great fires. They spent all night in turnings
without sleep: for if they warmed one side, they freezed on the other.
Some invented the weaving of certain mats of dry ivy, and did wear
one beneath, and another above: many laughed at this device, whom
afterward necessity enforced to do the like. The Christians were so
spoiled, and in such want of saddles and weapons which were burned,
that if the Indians had come the second night, they had overcome
them with little labor. They removed thence to the town where the
cacique was wont to lie, because it was in a champaign country. Within
eight days after, there were many lances and saddles made. There
were ash-trees in those parts, whereof they made as good lances as in
Biscay.</p>

<p>Upon Wednesday, the 15th of March, 1541, after the Governor
had lodged eight days in a plain, half a league from the place which
he had wintered in, after he had set up a forge, and tempered the
swords which in <i>Chicaça</i> were burned, and made many targets,
saddles, and lances; on Tuesday night, at the morning watch, many
Indians came to assault the camp in three squadrons, every one by
themselves. Those which watched gave the alarm. The Governor<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a>
with great speed set his men in order in other three squadrons, and
leaving some to defend the camp, went out to encounter them. The
Indians were overcome and put to flight. The ground was champaign
and fit for the Christians to take the advantage of them; and it
was now break of day. But there happened a disorder, whereby there
were not past thirty or forty Indians slain: and this it was: that a
friar cried out in the camp without any just occasion, "To the camp,
to the camp." Whereupon the Governor and all the rest repaired
thither, and the Indians had time to save themselves. There were
some taken, by whom the Governor informed himself of the country
through which he was to pass. The 25th of April, he departed from
<i>Chicaça</i>, and lodged at a small town called <i>Alimamu</i>. They had
very little maize, and they were to pass a desert of seven days' journey.
The next day, the Governor sent three captains, every one his way,
with horsemen and footmen to seek provisions to pass the desert.
And <i>John Dannusco</i> the Auditor went with fifteen horsemen and
forty footmen that way that the Governor was to go, and found a
strong fort made, where the Indians stayed for him, and many of them
walked on the top of it with their weapons, having their bodies, thighs,
and arms ochred and dyed with black, white, yellow and red, striped
like unto panes, so that they showed as though they went in hose and
doublets: and some of them had plumes, and others had horns on
their heads, and their faces black, and their eyes done round about
with steaks of red, to seem more fierce. As soon as they saw that
the Christians approached, with a great cry sounding two drums with
great fury they sallied forth to receive them. <i>John Dannusco</i> and
those that were with him thought good to avoid them, and to acquaint
the Governor therewith. They retired to a plain place, a crossbow-shot
from the fort, in sight of it: the footmen, the crossbow-men, and
targeters placed themselves before the horsemen, that they might not
hurt the horses. The Indians sallied out by seven and seven, and
eight and eight, to shoot their arrows, and retired again: and in sight
of the Christians they made a fire, and took an Indian, some by the
feet, and some by the head, and made as though they went to cast
him into the fire, and gave him first many knocks on the head: signifying
that they meant so to handle the Christians. <i>John Dannusco</i>
sent three horsemen to advertise the Governor hereof. He came presently:
for his intent was to drive them from thence, saying, that if
he did it not, they would be emboldened to charge him another time,
when they might do him more harm. He made the horsemen to<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>
alight, and set his men in four squadrons. The sign being given, they
set upon the Indians, which made resistance till the Christians came
near the fort, and as soon as they saw they could not defend themselves,
by a place where a brook passed near the fort, they ran away,
and from the other side they shot some arrows; and because at that
instant we knew no ford for the horses to pass, they had time enough
to get out of our danger. Three Indians were slain there, and many
Christians were hurt, whereof within few days, there died fifteen by
the way. All men thought the Governor to be in fault, because he
sent not to see the disposition of the place on the other side of the
river, and to know the passage before he set upon them. For with
the hope they had to save themselves by flight that way, when they
saw none other means, they fought till they were broken, and it was
an encouragement to defend themselves until then, and to offend the
Christians without any danger to themselves.</p>

<p>Three days after they had sought some maize, whereof they found
but little store, in regard of that which was needful, and that for this
cause, as well for their sakes that were wounded, it was needful for
them to rest, as for the great journey they were to march to come
where store of maize was: yet the Governor was enforced to depart
presently toward <i>Quizquiz</i>. He traveled seven days through a desert
of many marshes and thick woods: but it might all be traveled on
horseback, except some lakes which they swam over. He came to a town
of the province of <i>Quizquiz</i> without being descried, and took all the
people in it before they came out of their houses. The mother of the
cacique was taken there: and he sent unto him by an Indian, that
he should come to see him, and that he would give him his mother,
and all the people which he had taken there. The cacique sent him
answer again, that his lordship should loose and send them to him,
and that he would come to visit and serve him. The Governor,
because his people for want of maize were somewhat weak and weary,
and the horses also were lean, determined to accomplish his request,
to see if he could have peace with him, and so commanded to set free
his mother and all the rest, and with loving words dismissed them and
sent them to him. The next day, when the Governor expected the
cacique, there came many Indians with their bows and arrows with a
purpose to set upon the Christians. The Governor had commanded
all the horsemen to be armed, and on horseback, and in readiness.
When the Indians saw that they were ready, they stayed a crossbow-shot
from the place where the Governor was, near a brook. And after<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>
half an hour that they had stood there still, there came to the camp
six principal Indians, and said, "they came to see what people they
were, and that long ago, they had been informed by their forefathers
that a white people should subdue them; and that therefore they
would return to their cacique, and bid him come presently to obey
and serve the Governor:" and after they had presented him with six
or seven skins and mantles which they brought, they took their
leave of him, and returned with the others, which waited for them by
the brook side. The cacique never came again nor sent other message.
And because in the town where the Governor lodged, there
was small store of maize, he removed to another half a league from
<i>Rio Grande</i>,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> where they found plenty of maize. And he went to see
the river, and found, that near unto it was great store of timber to
make barges, and good situation of ground to encamp in. Presently
he removed himself thither. They made houses, and pitched their
camp in a plain field a crossbow-shot from the river. And thither
was gathered all the maize of the towns which they had lately passed.
They began presently to cut and hew down timber, and to saw planks
for barges. The Indians came presently down the river: they
leaped on shore, and declared to the Governor, "that they were subjects
of a great lord, whose name was <i>Aquixo</i>, who was lord of many
towns, and governed many people on the other side of the river, and
came to tell him on his behalf, that the next day he with all his men
would come to see what it would please him to command him." The
next day, with speed, the cacique came with two hundred canoes full
of Indians with their bows and arrows, painted, and with great plumes
of white feathers, and many other colors, with shields in their hands,
wherewith they defended the rowers on both sides, and the men of
war stood from the head to the stern, with their bows and arrows in
their hands. The canoe wherein the cacique was, had a tilt over the
stern, and he sat under the tilt; and so were other canoes of the
principal Indians. And from under the tilt where the chief man sat,
he governed and commanded the other people. All joined together,
and came within a stone's cast of the shore. From thence the cacique
said to the Governor, which walked along the river's side with others
that waited on him, that he was come thither to visit, to honor, and
to obey him; because he knew he was the greatest and mightiest
lord on the earth: therefore he would see what he would command
him to do. The Governor yielded him thanks, and requested him to<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>
come on shore, that they might the better communicate together.
And without any answer to that point, he sent him three canoes,
wherein was great store of fish and loaves, made of the substance of
prunes like unto bricks. After he had received all, he thanked him,
and prayed him again to come on shore. And because the cacique's
purpose was, to see if with dissimulation he might do some hurt,
when they saw that the Governor and his men were in readiness, they
began to go from the shore: and with a great cry, the crossbow-men
which were ready, shot at them, and slew five or six of them. They
retired with great order: none did leave his oar, though the next to
him were slain, and shielding themselves, they went farther off.
Afterward they came many times and landed: and when any of us
came toward them, they fled into their canoes, which were very
pleasant to behold: for they were very great and well made, and had
their tilts, plumes, paueses, and flags, and with the multitude of people
that were in them, they seemed to be a fair army of galleys. In
thirty days' space, while the Governor remained there, they made four
barges: in three of which he commanded twelve horsemen to enter,
in each of them four. In a morning, three hours before day, men
which he trusted would land in despite of the Indians, and make
sure the passage, or die, and some footmen, being crossbow-men, went
with them, and rowers to set them on the other side. And in the
other barge he commanded <i>John de Guzman</i> to pass with the footmen,
which was made captain instead of <i>Francisco Maldonado</i>. And
because the stream was swift, they went a quarter of a league up the
river along the bank, and crossing over, fell down with the stream,
and landed right over against the camp. Two stones' cast before they
came to land, the horsemen went out of the barges on horseback to a
sandy plot very hard and clear ground, where all of them landed
without any resistance. As soon as those that passed first were on
land on the other side, the barges returned to the place where the
Governor was: and within two hours after sun rising, all the people
were over. The river was almost half a league broad. If a man
stood still on the other side, it could not be discerned whether he was
a man or no. The river was of great depth, and of a strong current:
the water was always muddy: there came down the river continually
many trees and timber, which the force of the water and stream
brought down. There was great store of fish in it of sundry sorts,
and the most of it differing from the fresh water fish of <i>Spain</i>, as
hereafter shall be showed.<a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a></p>

<p>Having passed <i>Rio Grande</i>, the Governor traveled a league and
a half, and came to a great town of <i>Aquixo</i>, which was dispeopled
before he came thither. They espied thirty Indians coming over a plain,
which the cacique sent to discover the Christians' determination; and
as soon as they had sight of them, they took themselves to flight. The
horsemen pursued them, and slew ten, and took fifteen. And because
the town, whither the Governor went, was near unto the river, he sent
a captain, with as many men as he thought sufficient, to carry the
barges up the river. And because in his traveling by land many times
he went far from the river to compass the creeks that came from it,
the Indians took occasion to set upon them of the barges, and put them
in great danger, because that by reason of the great current, they durst
not leave the shore, and from the bank they shot at them. As soon
as the Governor was come to the town, he presently sent crossbow-men
down the river, which came to rescue them and upon the coming
of the barges to the town, he commanded them to be broken, and to
save the iron for others, when it should be needful. He lay there
one night, and the day following he set forward to seek a province,
called <i>Pacaha</i>, which he was informed to be near unto <i>Chisca</i>, where
the Indians told him there was gold. He passed through great towns
of <i>Aquixo</i>, which were all abandoned for fear of the Christians. He
understood by certain Indians that were taken that three days' journey
from thence dwelt a great cacique, whose name was <i>Casqui</i>. He
came to a small river, where a bridge was made, by which they passed;
that day till sunset, they went all in water, which in some places came
to the waist, and in some to the knees. When they saw themselves
on dry land, they were very glad, because they feared they should
wander up and down as forlorn men all night in the water. At noon
they came to the first town of <i>Casqui</i>: they found the Indians careless,
because they had no knowledge of them. There were many men and
women taken, and store of goods, as mantles and skins, as well in the
first town, as in another, which stood in a field half a league from
thence in sight of it; whither the horsemen ran. This country is
higher, drier, and more champaign, than any part bordering near the
river that until then they had seen. There were in the fields many
walnut trees, bearing soft-shelled walnuts in the fashion like bullets,
and in the houses they found many of them, which the Indians had
laid up in store. The trees differed in nothing else from those of
<i>Spain</i>, nor from those which we had seen before, but only that they
have a smaller leaf. There were many mulberry trees and plum trees,<a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>
which bare red plums like those of <i>Spain</i>, and others gray, somewhat
differing, but far better. And all the trees are all the year so fruitful,
as if they were planted in orchards; and the woods were very thin.
The Governor traveled two days through the country of <i>Casqui</i>, before
he came to the town where the cacique was; and the most of the way
was alway by champaign ground, which was full of great towns, so that
from one town, you might see two or three. He sent an Indian to
certify the cacique that he was coming to the place where he was,
with intent to procure his friendship, and to hold him as his brother.
Whereunto he answered, that he should be welcome, and that he
would receive him with special good-will, and accomplish all that his
lordship would command him. He sent him a present upon the way;
to wit, skins, mantles, and fish: and after these compliments, the
Governor found all the towns, as he passed, inhabited with people,
which peaceably attended his coming, and offered him skins, mantles,
and fish. The cacique, accompanied with many Indians, came out of
the town, and stayed half a league on the way to receive the Governor,
and when he came to him, he spake these words following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Right high, right mighty, and renowned lord, your lordship is
most heartily welcome. As soon as I had notice of your lordship, of
your power, and your perfections, although you came into my country
killing and taking captives the inhabitants thereof and my subjects,
yet I determined to conform my will unto yours, and as your own to
interpret in good part all that your lordship did: believing that it
was convenient it should be so for some just respect, to prevent some
future matter revealed unto your lordship, and concealed from me.
For well may a mischief be permitted to avoid a greater, and that good
may come thereof: which I believe will so fall out. For it is no
reason to presume of so excellent a prince, that the nobleness of his
heart, and the effect of his will would permit him to suffer any unjust
thing. My ability is so small to serve you as your lordship deserveth,
that if you respect not mine abundant good-will, which humbly offereth
all kind of service, I deserve but little in your presence. But if it
be reason that this be esteemed, receive the same, myself, my country,
and subjects for yours, and dispose of me and them at your
pleasure. For if I were lord of all the world, with the same good-will
should your lordship by me be received, served and obeyed."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him to the purpose, and satisfied him in
few words. Within a while after both of them used words of great
offers and courtesy the one to the other, and the cacique requested<a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a>
him to lodge in his houses. The Governor, to preserve the peace the
better, excused himself, saying that he would lodge in the fields. And
because it was very hot, they camped near certain trees a quarter of a
league from the town. The cacique went to his town, and came again
with many Indians singing. As soon as they came to the Governor,
all of them prostrated themselves upon the ground. Among these
came two Indians that were blind. The cacique made a speech: to
avoid tediousness, I will only tell in a few words the substance of the
matter. He said, that seeing the Governor was the son of the Sun,
and a great lord, he besought him to do him the favor to give sight to
those two blind men. The blind men rose up presently, and very
earnestly requested the same of the Governor. He answered, that in
the high heavens was he that had power to give them health, and
whatsoever they could ask of him; whose servant he was: and that
this Lord made the heavens and the earth, and man after his own likeness,
and that he suffered upon the cross to save mankind, and rose
again the third day, and that he died as he was man, and as touching
his divinity, he was, and is immortal; and that he ascended into
heaven, where he standeth with his arms open to receive all such as
turn unto him: and straightway he commanded him to make a very
high cross of wood, which was set up in the highest place of the town;
declaring unto him, that the Christians worshiped the same in resemblance
and memory of that whereon Christ suffered. The Governor
and his men kneeled down before it, and the Indians did the like.
The Governor willed him, that from thenceforth he would worship the
same, and should ask whatsoever they stood in need of, of that Lord
that he told him was in heaven. Then he asked him how far it was
from thence to <i>Pacaha</i>. He said, one day's journey, and that at the
end of his country, there was a lake like a brook which falleth into
<i>Rio Grande</i>, and that he would send men before to make a bridge
whereby he might pass. The same day that the Governor departed
thence, he lodged at a town belonging to <i>Casqui</i>; and the next day
he passed in sight of other towns, and came to the lake, which was
half a crossbow shot over, of a great depth and current. At the time
of his coming, the Indians had made an end of the bridge, which was
made of timber, laid one tree after another: and on one side it had a
course of stakes higher than the bridge, for them that passed to take
hold on. The Cacique of <i>Casqui</i> came to the Governor, and brought
his people with him. The Governor sent word by an Indian to the
Cacique of <i>Pacaha</i>, that though he were enemy to the Cacique of<a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a>
<i>Casqui</i>, and though he were there, yet he would do him no disgrace
nor hurt, if he would attend him peaceably, and embrace his friendship;
but rather would intreat him as a brother. The Indian, which
the Governor sent, came again, and said that the cacique made no
account of that which he told him, but fled with all his men out at the
other side of the town. Presently the Governor entered, and ran
before with the horsemen, that way by which the Indians fled; and
at another town, distant a quarter of a league from thence, they took
many Indians; and as soon as the horsemen had taken them, they
delivered them to the Indians of <i>Casqui</i>, whom, because they were
their enemies, with much circumspection and rejoicing, they brought
to the town where the Christians were: and the greatest grief they had
was this, that they could not get leave to kill them. There were
found in the town many mantles, and deer skins, lion skins, and bear
skins, and many cat skins. Many came so far poorly appareled, and
there they clothed themselves: of the mantles, they made them coats
and cassocks, and some made gowns, and lined them with cat skins;
and likewise their cassocks. Of the deer skins, some made them also
jerkins, shirts, hose and shoes: and of the bear skins, they made them
very good cloaks: for no water could pierce them. There were targets
of raw ox hides found there; with which hides they armed their horses.</p>

<p>Upon Wednesday, the 19th of June, 1541, the Governor entered
into <i>Pacaha</i>. He lodged in the town, where the cacique used to reside,
which was very great, walled, and beset with towers, and many
loopholes were in the towers and wall. And in the town was great
store of old maize, and great quantity of new in the fields. Within
a league and half a league were great towns all walled. Where the
Governor was lodged was a great lake, that came near unto the wall;
and it entered into a ditch, that went round about the town, wanting
but a little to environ it around. From the lake to the great river
was made a wear by which the fish came into it; which the cacique
kept for his recreation and sport. With nets that were found in the
town, they took as much as they would; and took they never so
much, there was no want perceived. There was also great store of
fish in many other lakes that were thereabout, but it was soft, and not
so good as that which came from the river, and the most of it was
different from the fresh-water fish of <i>Spain</i>. There was a fish which
they called bagres; the third part of it was head, and it had on both
sides the gills, and along the sides great pricks like very sharp awls.
Those of the kind that were in the lakes were as big as pikes; and in<a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a>
the river there were some of an hundred, and of an hundred and fifty
pounds weight, and many of them were taken with the hook. There
was another fish like barbilles, and another like breams, headed like
a delicate fish, called in <i>Spain</i> besugo, between red and gray. This
was there of most esteem. There was another fish called peel fish;
it had a snout of a cubit long, and at the end of the upper lip it was
made like a peel. There was another fish called a western shad; and
all of them had scales, except the bagres, and the peel fish. There was
another fish which sometimes the Indians brought us, of the bigness
of a hog; they called it the pereo fish; it had rows of teeth beneath
and above. The Cacique of <i>Casqui</i> sent many times great
presents of fish, mantles, and skins. He told the Governor that he
would deliver the Cacique of <i>Pacaha</i> into his hands. He went to
<i>Casqui</i>, and sent many canoes up the river, and came himself by land
with many of his people. The Governor, with forty horsemen and
sixty footmen, took him along with him up the river. And his Indians
which were in the canoes, discovered where the Cacique of
<i>Pacaha</i> was, in a little island, situated between two arms of the
river. And five Christians entered into a canoe, wherein <i>Don Antonio
Osorio</i> went before, to see what people the cacique had with him.
There were in the isle five or six thousand souls. And as soon as
they saw them, supposing that the Indians which were in the other
canoes were also Christians, the cacique, and certain which were in
three canoes, which they had there with them, fled in great haste to
the other side of the river. The rest, with great fear and danger,
leapt into the river, where many people were drowned, especially women
and little children. Presently the Governor, who was on land,
not knowing what had happened to <i>Don Antonio</i> and those that
went with him, commanded the Christians with all speed to enter
with the Indians of <i>Casqui</i> in the canoes, which were quickly with
<i>Don Antonio</i> in the little island, where they took many men and
women, and much goods. Great store of goods, which the Indians
had laid upon hurdles of canes and rafts of timber to carry over to
the other side, drove down the river, wherewith the Indians of <i>Casqui</i>
filled their canoes; and for fear lest the Christians would take it from
them, the cacique went home with them down the river, without
taking his leave of the Governor; whereupon the Governor was highly
offended with him, and presently returning to <i>Pacaha</i>, he overran
the country of <i>Casqui</i> the space of two leagues, where he took twenty or
thirty of his men. And because his horses were weary, and he wanted<a name="page_174" id="page_174"></a>
time that day to go any farther, he returned to <i>Pacaha</i>, with determination
within three or four days after to invade <i>Casqui</i>. And presently
he let loose one of the Indians of <i>Pacaha</i>, and sent word by
him to the cacique, that if he would have his friendship, he should
repair unto him, and that both of them would make war upon <i>Casqui</i>.
And presently came many Indians that belonged to <i>Pacaha</i>, and
brought an Indian instead of the cacique, which was discovered by
the cacique's brother, which was taken prisoner. The Governor
wished the Indians that their master himself should come; for he
knew very well that that was not he, and told them that they could
do nothing which he knew not before they thought it. The next day
the cacique came, accompanied with many Indians, and with a present
of much fish, skins and mantles. He made a speech that all
were glad to hear, and concluded saying, that though his lordship,
without his giving occasion of offence had done him hurt in his
country and subjects, yet he would not therefore refuse to be his, and
that he would always be at his command. The Governor commanded
his brother to be loosed, and other principal Indians that were taken
prisoners. That day came an Indian from the Cacique of <i>Casqui</i>,
and said that his lord would come the next day to excuse himself
of the error which he had committed, in going away without license
of the Governor. The Governor willed the messenger to signify unto
him, that if he came not in his own person, he would seek him himself,
and give him such punishment as he deserved. The next day
with all speed came the Cacique of <i>Casqui</i>, and brought a present to
the Governor of many mantles, skins, and fish, and gave him a
daughter of his, saying that he greatly desired to match his blood
with the blood of so great a lord as he was, and therefore he
brought him his daughter, and desired him to take her to his
wife. He made a long and discreet oration, giving him great
commendations, and concluded, saying, that he should pardon his
going away without license, for that cross's sake which he had left
with him; protesting that he went away for shame of that which his
men had done without his consent. The Governor answered him
that he had chosen a good patron; and that if he had not come to
excuse himself, he had determined to seek him, to burn his towns, to
kill him and his people, and to destroy his country. To which he replied,
saying:</p>

<p>"My lord, I and mine are yours, and my country likewise is
yours; therefore if you had done so, you should have destroyed<a name="page_175" id="page_175"></a>
your own country, and have killed your own people; whatsoever shall
come unto me from your hand, I will receive as from my lord, as well
punishment as reward; and know you, that the favor which you did
me in leaving me the cross, I do acknowledge the same to be a very
great one, and greater than I have ever deserved. For you shall understand,
that with great droughts the fields of maize of my country
were withered; and as soon as I and my people kneeled before the
cross, and prayed for rain, presently our necessities were relieved."</p>

<p>The Governor made him and the Cacique of <i>Pacaha</i> friends; and
set them with him at his table to dine with him; and the caciques fell
at variance about the seats, which of them should sit on his right hand.
The Governor pacified them; telling them that among the Christians
all was one to sit on the one side, or on the other, willing them so to
behave themselves, seeing they were with him, that nobody might
hear them, and that every one should sit in the place that first he
lighted on. From thence he sent thirty horsemen and fifty footmen
to the province of <i>Caluça</i>, to see if from thence he might travel to
<i>Chisca</i>, where the Indians said there was a work of gold and copper.
They traveled seven days' journey, through a desert, and returned
very weary, eating green plums, and stalks of maize, which they
found in a poor town of six or seven houses. From thenceforward
towards the north, the Indians said that the country was very ill inhabited,
because it was very cold; and that there was such store of
oxen, that they could keep no corn for them; and that the Indians
lived upon their flesh. The Governor, seeing that toward that part
the country was so poor of maize that in it they could not be sustained,
demanded of the Indians which way it was most inhabited;
and they said, they had notice of a great province, and a very plentiful
country, which was called <i>Quigaute</i>, and that it was toward the
south.</p>

<p>The Governor rested in <i>Pacaha</i> forty days; in all which time the
two caciques served him with great store of fish, mantles, and skins,
and strove who should do him greatest service. At the time of his
departure the Cacique of <i>Pacaha</i> gave him two of his sisters, saying
that in sign of love that he might remember him, he should take
them for his wives: the one's name was <i>Macanoche</i>, and the other's
<i>Mochila</i>: they were well proportioned, tall of body, and well fleshed.
<i>Macanoche</i> was of a good countenance, and in her shape and physiognomy
looked like a lady; the other was strongly made. The Cacique
of <i>Casqui</i> commanded the bridge to be repaired, and the Governor<a name="page_176" id="page_176"></a>
returned through his country, and lodged in the field near his
town, whither he came with great store of fish, and two women, which
he exchanged with two Christians for two shirts. He gave us a
guide and men for carriages. The Governor lodged at a town of his,
and the next day at another near a river, whither he caused canoes
to be brought for him to pass over, and with his leave returned. The
Governor took his journey toward <i>Quigaute</i>. The fourth day of
August he came to the town, where the cacique used to keep his residence:
on the way he sent him a present of many mantles and
skins, and not daring to stay for him in the town, he absented himself.
The town was the greatest that was seen in Florida. The
Governor and his people lodged in the one-half of it; and within
few days, seeing the Indians became liars, he commanded the other
half to be burned, because it should not be a shelter for them, if
they came to assault him by night, nor a hinderance to his horsemen
for the resisting of them. There came an Indian very well accompanied
with many Indians, saying that he was the cacique. He
delivered him over to the men of his guard to look unto him. There
went and came many Indians, and brought mantles and skins. The
counterfeit cacique, seeing so little opportunity to execute his evil
thought, as he went one day abroad talking with the Governor, he
showed him such a pair of heels, that there was no Christian that
could overtake him, and he leaped into the river, which was a crossbow
shot from the town: and as soon as he was on the other side,
many Indians that were thereabout making a great cry began to shoot.
The Governor passed presently over to them with horsemen and footmen,
but they durst not tarry for him. Going forward on his way,
he came to a town where the people were fled, and a little further to
a lake, where the horses could not pass, and on the other side were
many women. The footmen passed, and took many of them, and
much spoil. The Governor came to the camp, and that night was a
spy of the Indians taken by them of the watch. The Governor asked
him, whether he would bring him where the cacique was? he said
he would. And he went presently to seek him, with twenty horsemen
and fifty footmen; and after he had sought him a day and a
half, he found him in a strong wood: and a soldier, not knowing him,
gave him a wound on the head; and he cried out, that he should not
kill him, saying that he was the cacique; so he was taken, and a
hundred and forty of his men with him. The Governor came again
to <i>Quigaute</i>, and willed him to cause his men to come to serve the<a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a>
Christians; and staying some days for their coming, and seeing
they came not, he sent two captains, every one his way on both
sides of the river with horsemen and footmen. They took many men
and women. Now seeing the hurt which they sustained for their
rebellion, they came to see what the Governor would command them,
and passed to and fro many times, and brought presents of cloth and
fish. The cacique and his two wives were in the lodging of the Governor
loose, and the halberdiers of his guard did keep them. The
Governor asked them which way the country was most inhabited?
They said, that toward the south down the river, were great towns
and caciques, which commanded great countries, and much people.
And that toward the north-west, there was a province near to certain
mountains, that was called <i>Coligoa</i>. The Governor and all the rest
thought good to go first to <i>Coligoa</i>: saying, that peradventure the
mountains would make some difference of soil, and that beyond them
there might be some gold or silver. As for <i>Quigaute</i>, <i>Casqui</i>, and
<i>Pacaha</i>, they were plain countries, fat grounds, and full of good
meadows on the rivers, where the Indians sowed large fields of maize.
From <i>Tascaluca</i> to <i>Rio Grande</i>, or the Great River, is about three
hundred leagues: it is a very low country, and hath many lakes.
From <i>Pacaha</i> to <i>Quigaute</i> may be an hundred leagues. The Governor
left the Cacique of <i>Quigaute</i> in his own town. And an Indian,
which was his guide, led him through great woods without any
way, seven days' journey through a desert, where, at every lodging,
they lodged in lakes and pools in very shoal water; there was such
store of fish, that they killed them with cudgels; and the Indians
which they carried in chains, with the mud troubled the waters, and
the fish being therewith, as it were, astonished, came to the top of the
water, and they took as much as they listed. The Indians of <i>Coligoa</i>
had no knowledge of the Christians, and when they came so near the
town that the Indians saw them, they fled up a river which passed
near the town, and some leaped into it; but the Christians went on
both sides of the river, and took them. There were many men and
women taken, and the cacique with them. And by his commandment
within three days came many Indians with a present of mantles and
deers' skins, and two ox hides: and they reported, that five or six
leagues from thence toward the north, there were many of these oxen,
and that because the country was cold, it was evil inhabited; that
the best country which they knew, the most plentiful, and most inhabited,
was a province called <i>Cayas</i>, lying toward the south. From<a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>
<i>Quigaute</i> to <i>Coligoa</i> may be forty leagues. This town of <i>Coligoa</i>
stood at the foot of a hill, on the bank of a mean river, of the bigness
of <i>Cayas</i>, the river that passeth by <i>Estremadura</i>. It was a fat
soil and so plentiful of maize, that they cast out the old, to bring in
the new. There was also great plenty of French beans and pompions.
The French beans were greater, and better than those of <i>Spain</i>, and
likewise the pompions, and being roasted, they have almost the
taste of chestnuts. The Cacique of <i>Coligoa</i> gave a guide to <i>Cayas</i>,
and stayed behind in his own town. We traveled five days, and
came to the province of <i>Palisema</i>. The house of the cacique was
found covered with deers' skins, of divers colors and works drawn in
them, and with the same in manner of carpets was the ground of the
house covered. The cacique left it so, that the Governor might lodge in
it, in token that he sought peace and his friendship. But he durst not
tarry his coming. The Governor, seeing he had absented himself,
sent a captain with horsemen and footmen to seek him. He found
much people, but by reason of the roughness of the country, he took
none save a few women and children. The town was little and scattering,
and had very little maize. For which cause the Governor
speedily departed from thence. He came to another town called
<i>Tatalicoya</i>; he carried with him the cacique thereof, which guided
him to <i>Cayas</i>. From <i>Tatalicoya</i> are four days' journey to <i>Cayas</i>.
When he came to <i>Cayas</i>, and saw the town scattered, he thought
they had told him a lie, and that it was not the province of <i>Cayas</i>,
because they had informed him that it was well inhabited. He
threatened the cacique, charging him to tell him where he was: and
he and other Indians which were taken near about that place, affirmed
that this was the town of <i>Cayas</i>, and the best that was in that country,
and that though the houses were distant the one from the other,
yet the ground that was inhabited was great, and that there was great
store of people, and many fields of maize. This town was called
<i>Tanico</i>; he pitched his camp in the best part of it, near unto a river.
The same day that the Governor came thither, he went a league farther
with certain horsemen, and without finding any people, he found
many skins in a pathway, which the cacique had left there, that they
might be found, in token of peace. For so is the custom in that
country.</p>

<p>The Governor rested a month in the province of <i>Cayas</i>. In which
time the horses fattened and thrived more, than in other places in a
longer time, with the great plenty of maize and the leaves thereof,<a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>
which I think was the best that has been seen, and they drank of a
lake of very hot water, and somewhat brackish, and they drank so
much, that it swelled in their bellies when they brought them from
the watering. Until that time the Christians wanted salt, and there
they made good store, which they carried along with them. The
Indians do carry it to other places to exchange it for skins and mantles.
They make it along the river, which when it ebbeth, leaveth it upon
the upper part of the sand. And because they cannot make it, without
much sand mingled with it, they throw it into certain baskets
which they have for that purpose, broad at the mouth and narrow at
the bottom, and set it in the air upon a bar, and throw water into it,
and set a small vessel under it, wherein it falleth: Being strained and
set to boil upon the fire, when the water is sodden away, the salt
remaineth in the bottom of the pan. On both sides of the river the
country was full of sown fields, and there was store of maize. The
Indians durst not come over where we were; and when some of them
showed themselves, the soldiers that saw them called unto them; then
the Indians passed the river, and came with them where the Governor
was. He asked them for the cacique. They said that he remained quiet,
but that he durst not show himself. The Governor presently sent
him word, that he should come unto him, and bring him a guide and
an interpreter for his journey, if he made account of his friendship:
and if he did not so, he would come himself to seek him, and that it
would be the worse for him. He waited three days, and seeing he
came not, he went to seek him, and brought him prisoner with 150 of
his men. He asked him, whether he had notice of any great cacique,
and which way the country was best inhabited. He answered, that
the best country thereabout was a province toward the south, a day
and a half's journey, which was called <i>Tulla</i>; and that he could give
him a guide, but no interpreter, because the speech of that country
was different from his, and because he and his ancestors had always
wars with the lords of that province; therefore they had no commerce,
nor understood one another's language. Immediately the Governor
with certain horsemen, and fifty footmen, departed towards <i>Tulla</i>, to
see if the country were such, as he might pass through it with all his
company: and as soon as he arrived there, and was espied of the
Indians, the country gathered together, and as soon as fifteen and twenty
Indians could assemble themselves, they set upon the Christians: and
seeing that they did handle them shrewdly, and that the horsemen
overtook them when they fled, they got up into the tops of their houses,<a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>
and sought to defend themselves with their arrows: and being beaten
down from one, they got up upon another. And while our men pursued
some, others set upon them another way. Thus the skirmish
lasted so long, that the horses were tired, and they could not make
them run. The Indians killed there one horse, and some were hurt.
There were fifteen Indians slain there, and forty women and boys were
taken prisoners. For whatsoever Indian did shoot at them, if they
could come by him, they put him to the sword. The Governor
determined to return toward <i>Cayas</i>, before the Indians had time to
gather a head; and presently that evening, going part of the night to
leave <i>Tulla</i>, he lodged by the way, and the next day came to <i>Cayas</i>:
and within three days after he departed thence towards <i>Tulla</i> with all
his company. He carried the cacique along with him, and among all
his men, there was not one found that could understand the speech of
<i>Tulla</i>. He stayed three days by the way, and the day that he came
thither, he found the town abandoned: for the Indians durst not tarry
his coming. But as soon as they knew that the Governor was in
<i>Tulla</i>, the first night about the morning watch, they came in two
squadrons two several ways, with their bows and arrows, and long
staves like pikes. As soon as they were descried, both horse and foot
sallied out upon them, where many of the Indians were slain: and
some Christians and horses were hurt. Some of the Indians were
taken prisoners, whereof the Governor sent six to the cacique, with
their right hands and noses cut off: and sent him word, that if he
came not to him to excuse and submit himself, that he would come to
seek him, and that he would do the like to him, and as many of his
as he could find, as he had done to those which he had sent him: and
gave him three days' respite for to come. And this he gave them to
understand by signs, as well as he could, for there was no interpreter.
At the three days' end, there came an Indian laden with ox hides.
He came weeping with great sobs, and coming to the Governor cast
himself down at his feet. He took him up, and he made a speech, but
there was none that understood him. The Governor by signs commanded
him to return to the cacique, and to will him to send him an
interpreter, which could understand the men of <i>Cayas</i>. The next
day came three Indians laden with ox hides: and within three days
after came 20 Indians, and among them one that understood them of
<i>Cayas</i>; who, after a long oration of excuses of the cacique, and praises
of the Governor, concluded with this, that he and the other were come
thither on the cacique's behalf, to see what his lordship would command<a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a>
him to do, for he was ready at his commandment. The Governor
and all his company were very glad. For in nowise could they travel
without an interpreter. The Governor commanded him to be kept
safe, and bade him tell the men that came with him, that they should
return to the cacique, and signify unto him, that he pardoned him for
that which was past, and thanked him much for his presents and
interpreter, which he had sent him, and that he would be glad to see
him, and that he should come the next day to talk with him. After
three days, the cacique came, and eighty Indians with him; and himself
and his men came weeping into the camp, in token of obedience and
repentance for the error passed, after the manner of that country.
He brought a present of many ox hides: which, because the country
was cold, were very profitable, and served for coverlets, because they
were very soft, and wooled like sheep. Not far from thence toward
the north were many oxen. The Christians saw them not, nor came
into the country where they were, because those parts were evil inhabited,
and had small store of maize where they were bred. The Cacique of
<i>Tulla</i> made an oration to the Governor, wherein he excused himself, and
offered him his country, subjects, and person. As well this cacique
as the others, and all those which came to the Governor on their
behalf, delivered their message or speech in so good order, that no
orator could utter the same more eloquently.</p>

<p>The Governor informed himself of all the country round about; and
understood, that toward the west was a scattered dwelling, and that
toward the southeast were great towns, especially in a province called
<i>Autiamque</i>, ten days' journey from <i>Tulla</i>; which might be about eighty
leagues; and that it was a plentiful country of maize. And because
winter came on, and that they could not travel two or three months
in the year for cold, waters, and snow: and fearing, that if they should
stay so long in the scattered dwelling, they could not be sustained;
and also because the Indians said, that near to <i>Autiamque</i> was a great
water, and according to their relation, the Governor thought it was
some arm of the sea: and because he now desired to send news of
himself to <i>Cuba</i>, that some supply of men and horses might be sent
unto him (for it was about three years since <i>Donna Isabella</i>, which
was in <i>Havana</i>, or any other person in Christendom had heard of him,
and by this time he had lost 250 men, and 150 horses), he determined
to winter in <i>Autiamque</i>, and the next spring to go to the sea coast and
make two brigantines, and send one of them to <i>Cuba</i>, and the other
to <i>Nueva Espanna</i>, that that which went in safety, might give news<a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>
of him: hoping with the goods which he had in <i>Cuba</i>, to furnish himself
again, and to attempt the discovery and conquest toward the west:
for he had not yet come where <i>Cabeça de Vaca</i> had been. Thus
having sent away the two caciques of <i>Cayas</i> and <i>Tulla</i>, he took his
journey toward <i>Autiamque</i>: he traveled five days over rough mountains,
and came to a town called <i>Quipana</i>, where no Indians could be
taken for the roughness of the country: and the town being between
hills, there was an ambush laid, wherewith they took two Indians;
which told them, that <i>Autiamque</i> was six days' journey from thence,
and that there was another province toward the south, eight days'
journey off, plentiful of maize, and very well peopled, which was called
<i>Guahate</i>. But because <i>Autiamque</i> was nearer, and the most of the
Indians agreed of it, the Governor made his journey that way. In
three days he came to a town called <i>Anoixi</i>. He sent a captain before
with thirty horsemen and fifty footmen, and took the Indians careless;
he took many men and women prisoners. Within two days after the
Governor came to another town called <i>Catamaya</i>, and lodged in the
fields of the town. Two Indians came with a false message from the
cacique to know his determination. He bade them tell their lord, that
he should come and speak with him. The Indians returned and came
no more, nor any other message from the cacique. The next day the
Christians went to the town, which was without people: they took as
much maize as they needed. That day they lodged in a wood, and
the next day they came to <i>Autiamque</i>. They found much maize laid
up in store, and French beans, and walnuts, and prunes, great store
of all sorts. They took some Indians which were gathering together
the stuff which their wives had hidden. This was a champaign country,
and well inhabited. The Governor lodged in the best part of the
town, and commanded presently to make a fence of timber round about
the camp distant from the houses, that the Indians might not hurt
them without by fire. And measuring the ground by paces, he
appointed every one his part to do according to the number of Indians
which he had: presently the timber was brought by them; and in
three days there was an inclosure made of very high and thick posts
thrust into the ground, and many rails laid across. Hard by this
town passed a river, that came out of the province of <i>Cayas</i>; and
above and beneath it was very well peopled. Thither came Indians
on the cacique's behalf with a present of mantles and skins; and an
halting cacique, subject to the lord of <i>Autiamque</i>, lord of a town called
<i>Tietiquaquo</i>, came many times to visit the Governor, and to bring him<a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a>
presents of such as he had. The Cacique of <i>Autiamque</i> sent to know
of the Governor, how long time he meant to stay in his country?
And understanding that he meant to stay about three days, he never
sent any more Indians, nor any other message, but conspired with the
lame cacique to rebel. Divers inroads were made, wherein there were
many men and women taken, and the lame cacique among the rest.
The Governor respecting the services which he had received of him,
reprehended and admonished him, and set him at liberty, and gave
him two Indians to carry him in a chair upon their shoulders. The
Cacique of <i>Autiamque</i> desiring to thrust the Governor out of his country,
set spies over him. And an Indian coming one night to the gate of
the inclosure, a soldier that watched espied him, and stepping behind
the gate, as he came in, he gave him such a thrust, that he fell down;
and so he carried him to the Governor: and as he asked him wherefore
he came, not being able to speak, he fell down dead. The night
following the Governor commanded a soldier to give the alarm, and
to say that he had seen Indians, to see how ready they would be to
answer the alarm. And he did so sometimes as well there, as in other
places, when he thought that his men were careless, and reprehended
such as were slack. And as well for this cause, as in regard of doing
their duty, when the alarm was given, every one sought to be the
first that should answer. They staid in <i>Autiamque</i> three months, with
great plenty of maize, French beans, walnuts, prunes, and conies:
which until that time they knew not how to catch. And in <i>Autiamque</i>
the Indians taught them how to take them; which was, with great
springs, which lifted up their feet from the ground: and the snare
was made with a strong string, whereunto was fastened a knot of
a cane, which ran close about the neck of the cony, because they
should not gnaw the string. They took many in the fields of maize,
especially when it froze or snowed. The Christians
stayed there one
whole month so inclosed with snow, that they went not out of the
town: and when they wanted firewood, the Governor with his horsemen
going and coming many times to the wood, which was two crossbow
shots from the town, made a pathway, whereby the footmen went
for wood. In this mean space, some Indians which went loose, killed
many conies with their gyves, and with arrows. These conies were
of two sorts, some were like those of <i>Spain</i>, and the other of the
same color and fashion, and as big as great hares, longer, and having
greater loins.</p>

<p>Upon Monday the 6th of March, 1542, the Governor departed from<a name="page_184" id="page_184"></a>
<i>Autiamque</i> to seek <i>Nilco</i>, which the Indians said was near the great
river, with determination to come to the sea, and procure some succor
of men and horses; for he had now but three hundred men of war,
and forty horses, and some of them lame, which did nothing but help
to make up the number; and for want of iron they had gone above a
year unshod; and because they were used to it in the plain country,
it did them no great harm. <i>John Ortiz</i> died in <i>Autiamque</i>, which
grieved the Governor very much; because that without an interpreter
he feared to enter far into the land, where he might be lost. From
thenceforward a youth that was taken in <i>Cutifachiqui</i> did serve for
interpreter, which had by that time learned somewhat of the Christians'
language. The death of <i>John Ortiz</i> was so great a mischief
for the discovering inward, or going out of the land, that to learn of
the Indians, that which in four words he declared, they needed a
whole day with the youth; and most commonly he understood quite
contrary that which was asked him; whereby it often happened that
the way that they went one day, and sometimes two or three days,
they turned back, and went astray through the wood here and there.
The Governor spent ten days in traveling from <i>Autiamque</i> to a province
called <i>Ayays</i>; and came to a town that stood near the river
that passeth by <i>Cayas</i> and <i>Autiamque</i>. There he commanded a
barge to be made, wherewith he passed the river. When he had
passed the river there fell out such weather, that four days he could
not travel for snow. As soon as it gave over snowing, he went three
days' journey through a wilderness, and a country so low, and so full
of lakes and evil ways, that he traveled a whole day in water, sometimes
knee deep, sometimes to the stirrup, and sometimes they swam.
He came to a town called <i>Tutelpinco</i>, abandoned, and without maize.
There passed by it a lake, that entered into the river, which carried a
great stream and force of water. Five Christians passing over it in a
periagua, which the Governor had sent with a captain, the periagua
overset. Some took hold on it, some on the trees that were in the
lake. One <i>Francis Sebastian</i>, an honest man of <i>Villa nova de Barca
Rota</i>, was drowned there. The Governor went a whole day along the
lake, seeking passage, and could find none, nor any way that did pass
to the other side. Coming again at night to the town he found two
peaceable Indians, which showed him the passage, and which way he
was to go. There they made of canes and of the timber of houses
thatched with cane, rafts, wherewith they passed the lake. They
traveled three days, and came to a town of the territory of <i>Nilco</i>,<a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a>
called <i>Tianto</i>. There they took thirty Indians, and among them two
principal men of this town. The Governor sent a captain, with horsemen
and footmen, before to <i>Nilco</i>, because the Indians might have no
time to carry away the provision. They passed through three or four
great towns; and in the town where the cacique was resident, which was
two leagues from the place where the Governor remained, they found
many Indians with their bows and arrows, in manner as though they
would have stayed to fight, which did compass the town; and as soon
as they saw the Christians come near them, without misdoubting
them, they set the cacique's house on fire, and fled over a lake that
passed near the town, through which the horses could not pass. The
next day being Wednesday, the 29th of March, the Governor came
to <i>Nilco</i>; he lodged with all his men in the cacique's town, which
stood in a plain field, which was inhabited for the space of a quarter
of a league: and within a league and half a league were other very
great towns, wherein was great store of maize, of French beans, of
walnuts, and prunes. This was the best inhabited country that was
seen in <i>Florida</i>, and had most store of maize, except <i>Coça</i> and <i>Apalache</i>.
There came to the camp an Indian accompanied with others,
and in the cacique's name gave the Governor a mantle of martens'
skins, and a cordon of pearls. The Governor gave him a few small
margarites, which are certain beads much esteemed in <i>Peru</i>, and other
things, wherewith he was very well contented. He promised to return
within two days, but never came again: but on the contrary the
Indians came by night in canoes, and carried away all the maize they
could, and made them cabins on the other side of the river in the
thickest of the wood, because they might flee if we should go to seek
them. The Governor, seeing he came not at the time appointed, commanded
an ambush to be laid about certain store-houses near the
lake, whither the Indians came for maize: where they took two Indians,
who told the Governor, that he which came to visit him, was
not the cacique, but was sent by him under pretence to spy whether
the Christians were careless, and whether they determined to settle
in that country or to go forward. Presently the Governor sent a captain
with footmen and horsemen over the river; and in their passage they
were descried of the Indians, and therefore he could take but ten or
twelve men and women, with whom he returned to the camp. This
river, which passed by <i>Nilco</i>, was that which passed by <i>Cayas</i> and
<i>Autiamque</i>, and fell into <i>Rio Grande</i>, or the Great River, which
passed by <i>Pachaha</i> and <i>Aquixo</i> near unto the province of <i>Guachoya</i>:
and the lord thereof came up the river in canoes to make war with<a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a>
him of <i>Nilco</i>. On his behalf there came an Indian to the Governor
and said unto him, that he was his servant, and prayed him so to
hold him, and that within two days he would come to kiss his lordship's
hands: and at the time appointed he came with some of his
principal Indians, which accompanied him, and with words of great
offers and courtesy he gave the Governor a present of many mantles
and deers' skins. The Governor gave him some other things in recompense,
and honored him much. He asked him what towns there
were down the river? He answered that he knew none other but his
own: and on the other side of the river the province of a cacique called
<i>Quigalta</i>. So he took his leave of the Governor and went to his own
town. Within a few days the Governor determined to go to <i>Guachoya</i>,
to learn there whether the sea were near, or whether there were any
habitation near, where he might relieve his company, while the
brigantines were making, which he meant to send to the land of the
Christians. As he passed the river of <i>Nilco</i>, there came in canoes
Indians of <i>Guachoya</i> up the stream, and when they saw him, supposing
that he came to seek them to do them some hurt, they returned
down the river, and informed the cacique thereof: who with
all his people, spoiling the town of all that they could carry away,
passed that night over to the other side of the <i>Rio Grande</i>, or the
Great River. The Governor sent a captain with fifty men in six
canoes down the river, and went himself by land with the rest: he
came to <i>Guachoya</i> upon Sunday, the 17th of April: he lodged
in the town of the cacique, which was enclosed about, and seated a
crossbow shot distant from the river. Here the river is called <i>Tamaliseu</i>,
and in <i>Nilco Tapatu</i>, and in <i>Coça Mico</i>, and in the port or
mouth <i>Ri</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the Governor came to <i>Guachoya</i>, he sent <i>John Danusco</i>
with as many men as could go in the canoes up the river. For when
they came down from <i>Nilco</i>, they saw on the other side of the river
new cabins made. <i>John Danusco</i> went and brought the canoes laden
with maize, French beans, prunes, and many loaves made of the substance
of prunes. That day came an Indian to the Governor from
the Cacique of <i>Guachoya</i>, and said that his lord would come the next
day. They next day they saw many canoes come up the river, and
on the other side of the Great River they assembled together in the
space of an hour: they consulted whether they should come or not;
and at length concluded to come, and crossed the river. In them
came the Cacique of <i>Guachoya</i>, and brought with him many Indians,
with great store of fish, dogs, deers' skins, and mantles: and as soon as<a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>
they landed, they went to the lodging of the Governor, and presented
him their gifts, and the cacique uttered these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mighty and excellent lord, I beseech your lordship to pardon me
the error which I committed in absenting myself, and not tarrying in
this town to have received and served your lordship; since, to obtain
this opportunity of time, was, and is as much as a great victory to me.
But I feared that which I needed not to have feared, and so did that
which was not reason to do. But as haste maketh waste, and I removed
without deliberation; so, as soon as I thought on it, I determined
not to follow the opinion of the foolish, which is to continue in
their error; but to imitate the wise and discreet, in changing my counsel,
and so I came to see what your lordship will command me to do,
that I may serve you in all things that are in my power."</p>

<p>The Governor received him with much joy, and gave him thanks
for his present and offer. He asked him, whether he had any notice
of the sea. He answered no, nor of any towns down the river on
that side; save that two leagues from thence was one town of a principal
Indian, a subject of his; and on the other side of the river, three
days' journey from thence down the river, was the province of <i>Quigalta</i>,
which was the greatest lord that was in that country! The
Governor thought that the cacique lied unto him, to rid him out of
his own towns, and sent <i>John Danusco</i> with eight horsemen down the
river, to see what habitation there was, and to inform himself, if there
were any notice of the sea. He traveled eight days, and at his return
he said, that in all that time he was not able to go above fourteen
or fifteen leagues, because of the great creeks that came out of the
river, and groves of canes, and thick woods that were along the banks
of the river, and that he had found no habitation. The Governor
fell into great dumps to see how hard it was to get to the sea; and
worse, because his men and horses every day diminished, being without
succor to sustain themselves in the country: and with that thought
he fell sick. But before he took his bed he sent an Indian to the
Cacique of <i>Quigalta</i> to tell him, that he was the child of the sun, and
that all the way that he came all men obeyed and served him, that
he requested him to accept of his friendship, and come unto him; for
he would be very glad to see him; and in sign of love and obedience
to bring something with him of that which in his country was most
esteemed. The cacique answered by the same Indian:</p>

<p>"That whereas he said he was the child of the sun, if he would
dry up the river he would believe him: and touching the rest, that he<a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>
was wont to visit none; but rather that all those of whom he had
notice did visit him, served, obeyed, and paid him tributes willingly
or perforce: therefore, if he desired to see him, it were best he should
come thither: that if he came in peace, he would receive him with
special good will; and if in war, in like manner he would attend him
in the town where he was, and that for him or any other he would
not shrink one foot back."</p>

<p>By that time the Indian returned with this answer, the Governor
had betaken himself to bed, being evil handled with fevers, and was
much aggrieved that he was not in case to pass presently the river
and to seek him, to see if he could abate that pride of his, considering
the river went now very strongly in those parts; for it was near
half a league broad, and sixteen fathoms deep, and very furious, and
ran with a great current; and on both sides there were many Indians,
and his power was not now so great, but that he had need to help
himself rather by slights than by force. The Indians of <i>Guachoya</i>
came every day with fish in such numbers, that the town was full of
them. The cacique said, that on a certain night he of <i>Quigalta</i>
would come to give battle to the Governor. Which the Governor
imagined that he had devised, to drive him out of his country, and
commanded him to be put in hold: and that night and all the rest,
there was good watch kept. He asked him wherefore <i>Quigalta</i> came
not? He said that he came, but that he saw him prepared, and
therefore durst not give the attempt: and he was earnest with him to
send his captains over the river, and that he would aid him with many
men to set upon <i>Quigalta</i>. The Governor told him that as soon as
he was recovered, himself would seek him out. And seeing how
many Indians came daily to the town, and what store of people was
in that country, fearing they should all conspire together and plot
some treason against him; and because the town had some open gaps
which were not made an end of inclosing, besides the gates which they
went in and out by: because the Indians should not think he feared
them, he let them all alone unrepaired; and commanded the horsemen
to be appointed to them, and to the gates: and all night the
horsemen went the round; and two and two of every squadron rode
about, and visited the scouts that were without the town in their standings
by the passages, and the crossbow-men that kept the canoes in
the river. And because the Indians should stand in fear of them, he
determined to send a captain to <i>Nilco</i>, for those of <i>Guachoya</i> had
told him that it was inhabited; that by using them cruelly, neither<a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a>
the one nor the other should presume to assail him; and he sent
<i>Nuñez de Touar</i> with fifteen horsemen, and <i>John de Guzman</i> captain
of the footmen, with his company in canoes up the river. The
Cacique of <i>Guachoya</i> sent for many canoes and many warlike Indians
to go with the Christians: and the captain of the Christians, called
<i>Nuñez de Touar</i> went by land with his horsemen, and two leagues
before he came to <i>Nilco</i> he stayed for <i>John de Guzman</i>, and in that
place they passed the river by night: the horsemen came first, and in
the morning by break of day in sight of the town they lighted upon a
spy; which as soon as he perceived the Christians, crying out amain
fled to the town to give warning. <i>Nuñez de Touar</i> and his company
made such speed, that before the Indians of the town could fully
come out, they were upon them: it was champaign ground that was
inhabited, which was about a quarter of a league. There were about
five or six thousand people in the town: and, as many people came
out of the houses, and fled from one house to another, and many Indians
came flocking together from all parts, there was never a horseman
that was not alone among many. The captain had commanded
that they should not spare the life of any male. Their disorder was
so great, that there was no Indian that shot an arrow at any Christian.
The shrieks of women and children were so great, that they made the
ears deaf of those that followed them. There were slain a hundred
Indians, little more or less: and many were wounded with great
wounds, whom they suffered to escape to strike a terror in the rest
that were not there. There were some so cruel and butcherlike, that
they killed old and young, and all that they met, though they made
no resistance: and those which presumed of themselves for their valor,
and were taken for such, broke through the Indians, bearing down
many with their stirrups and breasts of their horses; and some they
wounded with their lances, and so let them go: and when they saw
any youth or woman they took them, and delivered them to the footmen.
These men's sins by God's permission, lighted on their own
heads: who, because they would seem valiant, became cruel; showing
themselves extreme cowards in the sight of all men when as most
need of valor was required, and afterwards they came to a shameful
death. Of the Indians of <i>Nilco</i> were taken prisoners, fourscore women
and children, and much spoil. The Indians of <i>Guachoya</i> kept back
before they came at the town, and stayed without, beholding the success
of the Christians with the men of <i>Nilco</i>. And when they saw
them put to flight, and the horsemen busy in killing of them, they<a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a>
hastened to the houses to rob, and filled their canoes with the spoil
of the goods; and returned to <i>Guachoya</i> before the Christians; and
wondering much at the sharp dealing which they had seen them use
toward the Indians of <i>Nilco</i>, they told their cacique all that had passed
with great astonishment.</p>

<p>The Governor felt in himself that the hour approached wherein he
was to leave this present life, and called for the king's officers, captains,
and principal persons, to whom he made a speech, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That now he was to go to give an account before the presence of
God of all his life past: and since it pleased him to take him in such
a time, and that the time was come that he knew his death, that he
his most unworthy servant did yield him many thanks therefor; and
desired all that were present and absent (whom he confessed himself
to be much beholding unto for their singular virtues, love and loyalty,
which himself had well tried in the travels which they had suffered,
which always in his mind he did hope to satisfy and reward, when it
should please God to give him rest, with more prosperity of his estate),
that they would pray to God for him, that for his mercy he would
forgive him his sins, and receive his soul into eternal glory: and that
they would quit and free him of the charge which he had over them, and
ought unto them all, and that they would pardon him for some wrongs
which they might have received of him. And to avoid some division,
which upon his death might fall out upon the choice of his successor,
he requested them to elect a principal person, and able to govern, of
whom all should like well; and when he was elected, they should
swear before him to obey him: and that he would thank them very
much in so doing; because the grief that he had, would somewhat be
assuaged, and the pain that he felt, because he left them in so great
confusion, to wit, in leaving them in a strange country, where they
knew not where they were."</p>

<p><i>Baltasar de Gallegos</i> answered in the name of all the rest. And
first of all comforting him, he set before his eyes how short the life of
this world was, and with how many troubles and miseries it is accompanied,
and how God showed him a singular favor which soonest
left it: telling him many other things fit for such a time. And for
the last point, that since it pleased God to take him to himself, although
his death did justly grieve them much, yet as well he, as all
the rest, ought of necessity to conform themselves to the will of God.
And touching the Governor which he commanded they should elect,
he besought him, that it would please his lordship to name him which<a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a>
he thought fit, and him they would obey. And presently he named
<i>Luys de Moscoso de Alvarado</i>, his captain-general. And presently he
was sworn by all that were present, and elected for governor. The
next day, being the 21st of May, 1542, departed out of this life,
the valorous, virtuous, and valiant Captain, <i>Don Fernando de Soto</i>,
Governor of <i>Cuba</i>, and Adelantado of <i>Florida</i>: whom fortune advanced,
as it useth to do others, that he might have the higher fall.
He departed in such a place, and at such a time, as in his sickness he
had but little comfort: and the danger wherein all his people were of
perishing in that country, which appeared before their eyes, was cause
sufficient why every one of them had need of comfort, and why they
did not visit nor accompany him as they ought to have done. <i>Luys
de Moscoso</i> determined to conceal his death from the Indians, because
<i>Ferdinando de Soto</i> had made them believe that the Christians were
immortal; and also because they took him to be hardy, wise, and
valiant: and if they should know that he was dead, they would be
bold to set upon the Christians, though they lived peaceably by them.
In regard of their disposition, and because they were nothing constant,
and believed all that was told them, the Adelantado made them
believe, that he knew some things that passed in secret among themselves,
without their knowledge, how, or in what manner he came by
them: and that the figure which appeared in a glass, which he showed
them, did tell him whatsoever they practiced and went about: and
therefore neither in word nor deed durst they attempt anything that
might be prejudicial unto him.</p>

<p>As soon as he was dead, <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> commanded to put him
secretly in the house, where he remained three days; and removing
him from thence, commanded him to be buried in the night at one of
the gates of the town within the wall. And as the Indians had seen
him sick, and missed him, so did they suspect what might be. And
passing by the place where he was buried, seeing the earth moved,
they looked and spake one to another. <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> understanding
of it, commanded him to be taken up by night, and to cast a great deal
of sand into the mantles, wherein he was wound up, wherein he was
carried in a canoe, and thrown into the midst of the river. The Cacique
of <i>Guachoya</i> inquired for him, demanding what was become of his
brother and lord, the Governor: <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> told him that he was
gone to heaven, as many other times he did and because he was to
stay there certain days he had left him in his place. The cacique
thought with himself that he was dead; and commanded two young<a name="page_192" id="page_192"></a>
and well-proportioned Indians to be brought thither; and said, that
the use of that country was, when any lord died, to kill Indians to
wait upon him, and serve him by the way, and for that purpose by
his commandment were those come thither: and prayed <i>Luys de Moscoso</i>
to command them to be beheaded, that they might attend and
serve his lord and brother. <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> told him, that the Governor
was not dead, but gone to heaven, and that of his own Christian
soldiers, he had taken such as he needed to serve him, and prayed
him to command those Indians to be loosed, and not to use any such
bad custom from thenceforth: straightway he commanded them to
be loosed, and to get them home to their houses. And one of them
would not go; saying, that he would not serve him, that without desert
had judged him to death, but that he would serve him as long
as he lived, which had saved his life.</p>

<p><i>Luys de Moscoso</i> caused all the goods of the Governor to be sold
at an outcry: to wit, two men slaves and two women slaves, and three
horses, and seven hundred hogs. For every slave or horse, they gave
two or three thousand ducats: which were to be paid at the first
melting of gold or silver, or at the division of their portion of inheritance.
And they entered into bonds, though in the country there
was not wherewith, to pay it within a year after, and put in sureties
for the same. Such as in <i>Spain</i> had no goods to bind, gave two
hundred ducats for a hog, giving assurance after the same manner.
Those which had any goods in <i>Spain</i>, bought with more fear, and
bought the less. From that time forward, most of the company had
swine, and brought them up, and fed upon them; and observed
Fridays and Saturdays, and the evenings of feasts, which before they
did not. For some times in two or three months they did eat no
flesh, and whensoever they could come by it, they did eat it.</p>

<p>Some were glad of the death of <i>Don Ferdinando de Soto</i>, holding
for certain that <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> (which was given to his ease), would
rather desire to be among the Christians at rest, than to continue the
labors of the war in subduing and discovering of countries; whereof
they were already weary, seeing the small profit that ensued thereof.
The Governor commanded the captains and principal persons to meet
to consult and determine what they should do. And being informed
what peopled habitation was round about, he understood that to the
west, the country was most inhabited, and that down the river beyond
<i>Quigalta</i> was uninhabited, and had little store of food. He
desired them all, that every one would give his opinion in writing,<a name="page_193" id="page_193"></a>
and set his hand to it: that they might resolve by general consent,
whether they should go down the river, or enter into the main land.
All were of opinion, that it was best to go by land toward the west,
because <i>Nueva España</i> was that way; holding the voyage by sea
more dangerous, and of greater hazard, because they could make no
ship of any strength to abide a storm, neither had they master, nor
pilot, compass, nor chart, neither knew they how far the sea was off,
nor had any notice of it; nor whether the river did make any great
turning into the land, or had any great fall from the rocks, where all
of them might be cast away. And some which had seen the sea-chart,
did find, that from the place where they were by the sea-coast
to <i>Nueva España</i>, might be four hundred leagues, little more or less;
and said, that though they went somewhat about by land in seeking
a peopled country, if some great wilderness which they could not pass
did hinder them, by spending that summer in travel, finding provision
to pass the winter in some peopled country, that the next summer
after they might come to some Christian land, and that it might fortune
in their travel by land to find some rich country, where they
might do themselves good. The Governor, although he desired to
get out of <i>Florida</i> in shorter time, seeing the inconveniences they
laid before him, in traveling by sea, determined to follow that which
seemed good to them all. On Monday, the fifth day of June, he departed
from <i>Guachoya</i>. The cacique gave him a guide to <i>Chaguate</i>,
and stayed at home in his own town. They passed through a province
called <i>Catalte</i>: and having passed a wilderness of six days'
journey, the twentieth day of the month he came to <i>Chaguate</i>. The
cacique of this province had visited the Governor <i>Don Ferdinando de
Soto</i> at <i>Autiamque</i>, whither he brought him presents of skins, and
mantles, and salt. And a day before <i>Luys de Moscoso</i> came to his
town, we lost a Christian that was sick; which he suspected that the
Indians had slain. He sent the cacique word, that he should command
his people to seek him up, and send him unto him, and that
he would hold him, as he did, for his friend; and if he did not, that
neither he, nor his, should escape his hands, and that he would set
his country on fire. Presently the cacique came unto him, and
brought a great present of mantles and skins, and the Christian that
was lost, and made this speech following:</p>

<p>"Right excellent lord, I would not deserve that conceit which you
had of me, for all the treasure of the world. What enforced me to
go to visit and serve the excellent Lord Governor your father in
<i>Autiamque</i>, which you should have remembered, where I offered myself<a name="page_194" id="page_194"></a>
with all loyalty, faith and love, during my life to serve and obey
him? What then could be the cause, I having received favors of
him, and neither you nor he having done me any wrong, that should
move me to do the thing which I ought not? Believe this of me,
that neither wrong, nor any worldly interest, was able to make me to
have done it, nor shall be able to blind me. But as in this life it is
a natural course, that after one pleasure many sorrows do follow: so
by your indignation, fortune would moderate the joy, which my heart
conceiveth with your presence; and that I should err, where I thought
surest to have hit the mark; in harboring this Christian which was
lost, and using him in such manner, as he may tell himself, thinking
that herein I did you service, with purpose to deliver him unto you
in <i>Chaguate</i>, and to serve you to the uttermost of my power. If I
deserve punishment for this, I will receive it at your hands, as from
my lord, as if it were a favor. For the love which I did bear to the
excellent Governor, and which I bear to you hath no limit. And
like as you give me chastisement, so will you also show me favor.
And that which now I crave of you is this, to declare your will unto
me, and those things wherein I may be able to do you the most and
best service."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him, that because he did not find him in that
town, he was incensed against him, thinking he had absented himself,
as others had done: but seeing he now knew his loyalty and love, he
would always hold him as a brother, and favor him in all his affairs.
The cacique went with him to the town where he resided, which was
a day's journey from thence. They passed through a small town,
where there was a lake, where the Indians made salt: and the Christians
made some one day while they rested there, of a brackish water,
which sprang near the town in ponds like fountains. The Governor
stayed in <i>Chaguate</i> six days. There he was informed of the habitation
towards the west. They told him, that three days' journey from
thence was a province called <i>Aguacay</i>. The day that he departed
from <i>Chaguate</i>, a Christian, called <i>Francisco de Guzman</i>, the base
son of a gentleman of <i>Seville</i>, stayed behind, and went to the Indians,
with an Indian woman which he kept as his concubine, for fear he
should be punished for gaming debts that he did owe. The Governor
had traveled two days before he missed him; he sent the cacique word
to seek him up, and to send him to <i>Aguacay</i>, whither he traveled:
which he did not perform. From the Cacique of <i>Aguacay</i>, before
they came into the country, there met him on the way fifteen Indians
with a present of skins, fish, and roasted venison. The Governor<a name="page_195" id="page_195"></a>
came to this town on Wednesday, the fourth of July. He found the
town without people, and lodged in it: he stayed there about a day;
during which, he made some roads, and took many men and women.
There they had knowledge of the <i>South Sea</i>. Here there was great
store of salt made of sand, which they gather in a vein of ground
like pebble stones. And it was made as they made salt in <i>Cayas</i>.</p>

<p>The same day that the Governor departed from <i>Aguacay</i>, he lodged
in a small town subject to the lord of that province. The camp
was pitched hard by a lake of salt water; and that evening they made
some salt there. The day following he lodged between two mountains
in a thin grove of wood. The next day he came to a small
town called <i>Pato</i>. The fourth day after his departure from <i>Aguacay</i>
he came to the first habitation of a province called <i>Amaye</i>. There
an Indian was taken, which said that from thence to <i>Naguatex</i> was a
day and a half's journey; which they traveled, finding all the way
inhabited places. Having passed the peopled country of <i>Amaye</i>, on
Saturday, the twentieth of July, they pitched their camp at noon between
<i>Amaye</i> and <i>Naguatex</i> along the corner of a grove of very fair
trees. In the same place certain Indians were discovered, that came
to view them. The horsemen went out to them, and killed six, and
took two, whom the Governor asked, wherefore they came? They
said, to know what people he had, and what order they kept; and
that the Cacique of <i>Naguatex</i>, their lord, had sent them, and that he,
with other caciques which came to aid him, determined that day to
bid him battle. While they were occupied in these questions and
answers, there came many Indians by two ways in two squadrons: and
when they saw they were descried, giving a great cry they assaulted the
Christians each squadron by itself; but seeing what resistance the
Christians made them, they turned their backs and betook themselves
to flight, in which many of them lost their lives; and most of the
horsemen following them in chase, careless of the camp, other two
squadrons of Indians, which lay in ambush, set upon the Christians
that were in the camp, which also they resisted, who also had their
reward as the first. After the flight of the Indians, and that the
Christians were retired, they heard a great noise a crossbow shot from
the place where they were. The Governor sent twelve horsemen to
see what it was. They found six Christians, four footmen and two
horsemen, among many Indians; the horsemen defending the footmen
with great labor. These being of them that chased the first two
squadrons, had lost themselves, and coming to recover the camp fell
among those with whom they were fighting: and so they, and those<a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a>
that came to succor them, slew many of the Indians, and brought one
alive to the camp: whom the Governor examined, who they were that
came to bid him battle. He told him, that they were the Cacique of
<i>Naguatex</i>, and of <i>Amaye</i>, and another of a province called <i>Hacanac</i>,
a lord of great countries and many subjects; and that the Cacique of
<i>Naguatex</i> came for captain and chief of them all. The Governor
commanded his right arm and nose to be cut off, and sent him to the
Cacique of <i>Naguatex</i>, charging him to tell him, that the next day he
would be in his country to destroy him; and if he would withstand
his entrance, he should stay for him. That night he lodged there;
and the next day he came to the habitation of <i>Naguatex</i>, which was
very scattering: he inquired where the cacique's chief town was?
They told him that it was on the other side of a river, that passed
thereby: he traveled thitherward, and came unto it: and on the other
side he saw many Indians, that tarried for him, making show as
though they would defend the passage. And because he knew not
whether it could be waded, nor where the passage was, and that some
Christians and horses were hurt, that they might have time to recover,
he determined to rest certain days in the town where he was. So he
pitched his camp a quarter of a league from the river, because the
weather was very hot, near unto the town, in a thin grove of very
fair and high trees near a brook's side: and in that place were certain
Indians taken; whom he examined, whether the river were wadeable
or no? They said yea, at some times, and in some places. Within ten
days after he sent two captains with fifteen horsemen a piece upward
and down the river with Indians to show them where they should go
over, to see what habitation was on the other side. And the Indians
withstood them both, defending the passage of the river as far as they
were able, but they passed in despite of them: and on the other side
of the river they saw great habitation, and great store of victuals;
and with these news returned to the camp.</p>

<p>The Governor sent an Indian from <i>Naguatex</i> where he lay, to command
the cacique to come to serve and obey him, and that he would
forgive him all that was past; that if he came not, that he would
seek him, and give him such punishment as he had deserved for that
which he had done against him. Within two days the Indian returned,
and said that the cacique would come the next day; which,
the same day when he came, sent many Indians before him, among
whom there were some principal men: he sent them to see what countenance
they found in the Governor, to resolve with himself whether
he should go or not. The Indians let him understand, that he was<a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>
coming, and went away presently: and the cacique came within two
hours accompanied with many of his men: they came all in a rank
one before another on both sides, leaving a lane in the midst where
he came. They came where the Governor was, all of them weeping
after the manner of <i>Tulla</i>, which was not far from thence toward
the east. The cacique made his due obedience, and the speech following:</p>

<p>"Right high and mighty lord, whom all the world ought to serve
and obey, I was bold to appear before your lordship, having committed
so heinous and abominable an act, as only for me to have imagined,
deserved to be punished; trusting in your greatness, that although I
deserve to obtain no pardon, yet for your own sake only you will use
clemency toward me, considering how small I am in comparison of
your lordship; and not to think upon my weaknesses, which, to my
grief and for my greater good, I have known. And I believe that
you and yours are immortal; and that your lordship is lord of the
land of nature, seeing that you subdue all things, and they obey you,
even the very hearts of men. For when I beheld the slaughter and
destruction of my men in the battle, which, through mine ignorance,
and the counsel of a brother of mine, which died in the same, I gave
your lordship, presently I repented me in my heart of the error, which
I had committed; and desired to serve and obey you: and to this
end I come, that your lordship may chastise and command me as your
own."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him, that he forgave him all which was
past, that from thenceforth he should do his duty, and that he would
hold him for his friend, and that he would favor him in all things.
Within four days he departed thence, and coming to the river he
could not pass, because it was grown very big; which seemed to him
a thing of admiration, being at that time that it was, and since it
had not rained a month before. The Indians said, that it increased
many times after that manner without raining in all the country. It
was supposed, that it might be the tide that came into it. It was
learned that the flood came alway from above, and that the Indians of
all that country had no knowledge of the sea. The Governor returned
unto the place where he had lodged before: and understanding within
eight days after that the river was passable, he departed. He
passed over and found the town without people: he lodged in the
field, and sent the cacique word to come unto him, and to bring him
a guide to go forward. And some days being past, seeing the cacique
came not, nor sent anybody, he sent two captains sundry ways to burn<a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>
the towns, and to take such Indians as they could find. They burnt
great store of victuals, and took many Indians. The cacique seeing
the hurt that he received in his country, sent six principal Indians
with three men for guides, which knew the language of the country
through which the Governor was to pass. He departed presently
from <i>Naguatex</i>, and within three days' journey came to a town of
four or five houses, which belonged to the cacique of that province,
which is called <i>Nissoone</i>: it was evil inhabited, and had little maize.
Two days' journey forward the guides which guided the Governor, if
they were to go westward, guided him to the east; and sometimes
went up and down through very great woods out of the way. The
Governor commanded them to be hanged upon a tree: and a woman
that they took in <i>Nissoone</i> guided him, and went back again to seek
the way. In two days he came to another miserable town called
<i>Lacane</i>: an Indian was taken in that place, that said, that the country
of <i>Nondacao</i> was a country of great habitation, and the houses
scattering the one from the other, as they used to be in mountains,
and had great store of maize. The cacique came with his men weeping,
like them of <i>Naguatex</i>: for this is their use in token of obedience:
he made him a present of much fish, and offered to do what
he would command him. He took his leave, and gave him a guide
to the province of <i>Soacatino</i>.</p>

<p>The Governor departed from <i>Nondacao</i> towards <i>Soacatino</i>, and
in five days' journey came to a province called <i>Aays</i>. The Indians
which inhabited it had no notice of the Christians: but as soon as
they saw that they entered into their country, they assembled themselves:
and as they came together fifty or a hundred, they came forth
to fight. While some fought, others came and charged our men another
way, and while they followed some, others followed them. The
fight lasted the greatest part of the day, till they came to their town.
Some horses and men were wounded, but not to any hurt of their
traveling: for there was no wound that was dangerous. There was
a great spoil made of the Indians. That day that the Governor departed
from thence, the Indian that guided him said that in <i>Nondacao</i>
he had heard say, that the Indians of <i>Soacatino</i> had seen other
Christians, whereof they all were very glad: thinking it might be
true, and that they might have entered into those parts by <i>Nueva
España</i>; and that if it were so, it was in their own hand to go out
of <i>Florida</i>, if they found nothing of profit: for they feared they
should lose themselves in some wilderness. This Indian led him two
days out of the way. The Governor commanded to torture him.<a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>
He said, that the Cacique of <i>Nondacao</i>, his lord, had commanded him
to guide them so because they were his enemies, and that he was to do
as his lord commanded him. The Governor commanded him to be cast
to the dogs: and another guided him to <i>Soacatino</i>, whither he came the
day following. It was a very poor country: there was great want of
maize in that place. He asked the Indians whether they knew of
any other Christians. They said that a little from thence toward the
south they heard they were. He traveled twenty days through a country
evil inhabited, where they suffered great scarcity and trouble; for
that little maize which the Indians had, they had hidden and buried in
the woods, where the Christians, after they were well wearied with their
travel, at the end of their journey went to seek by digging what they
should eat. At last, coming to a province that was called <i>Guasco</i>, they
found maize, wherewith they loaded their horses and the Indians that
they had. From thence they went to another town called <i>Naquiscoça</i>.
The Indians said they had no notice of any other Christians. The
Governor commanded to torment them. They said, that they came
first to another lordship which was called <i>Naçacahoz</i>, and from
thence returned again to the west from whence they came. The
Governor came in two days to <i>Naçacahoz</i>. Some women were taken
there: among whom there was one which said that she had seen
Christians and had been taken by them, and had run away. The
Governor sent a captain with fifteen horsemen to the place where the
woman said she had seen them, to see if there was any sign of horses,
or any token of their being there. After they had gone three or four
leagues, the woman that guided them said that all that she had told
them was untrue. And so they held all the rest that the Indians had
said of seeing Christians in the land of <i>Florida</i>. And, because the
country that way was poor of maize, and toward the west there was
no notice of any habitation, they returned to <i>Guasco</i>. The Indians
told them there, that ten days' journey from thence toward the west,
was a river called <i>Daycao</i>, whither they went sometimes a hunting
and killing of deer: and that they had seen people on the other side,
but knew not what habitation was there. There the Christians took
such maize as they found and could carry, and going ten days' journey
through a wilderness, they came to the river which the Indians had
told them of. Ten horsemen, which the Governor had sent before,
passed over the same and went in a way that led to the river, and
lighted upon a company of Indians that dwelt in very little cabins:
who as soon as they saw them took themselves to flight, leaving that
which they had; all which was nothing but misery and poverty.<a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>
The country was so poor, that among them all there was not found
half a peck of maize. The horsemen took two Indians, and returned
with them to the river, where the Governor stayed for them. He
sought to learn of them what habitation was toward the west. There
was none in the camp that could understand their language. The
Governor assembled the captains and principal persons to determine
with their advice what they should do. And the most part said that
they thought it best to return back to <i>Rio Grande</i>, or the Great
River of <i>Guachoya</i>; because that in <i>Nilco</i> and thereabout was store
of maize; saying, that they would make pinnaces that winter, and the
next summer pass down the river to the seaward in them, and coming
to the sea they would go along the coast to <i>Nueva España</i>. For
though it seemed a doubtful thing and difficult, by that which they
had already alleged, yet it was the last remedy they had. For by
land they could not go for want of an interpreter. And they held,
that the country beyond the River of <i>Daycao</i>, where they were, was
that which <i>Cabeça de Vaca</i> mentioned in his relation that he passed
<i>of the Indians which lived like the Alarbes, having no settled place</i>,
and fed upon <i>Tunas</i> and roots of the fields, and wild beasts that they
killed. Which if it were so, if they should enter into it and find no
victuals to pass the winter, they could not choose but perish, for
they were entered already into the beginning of October: and if
they stayed any longer they were not able to return for rain and
snows, nor to sustain themselves in so poor a country. The Governor
(that desired long to see himself in a place where he might sleep his
full sleep, rather than to conquer and govern a country where so
many troubles presented themselves) presently returned back that
same way that he came.</p>

<p>When that which was determined was published in the camp, there
were many that were greatly grieved at it: for they held the sea voyage
as doubtful, for the evil means they had, and of as great danger
the traveling by land: and they hoped to find some rich country
before they came to the land of the Christians, by that which <i>Cabeça
de Vaca</i> had told the Emperor: and that was this: That after he had
found clothes made of cotton wool, he saw gold and silver, and stones
of great value. And they had not yet come where he had been.
For until that place he always traveled by the sea-coast: and they
traveled far within the land; and that going towards the west, of
necessity they should come where he had been. For he said that in
a certain place he traveled many days, and entered into the land toward
the north. And in <i>Guasco</i> they had already found some Turkey<a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>
stones, and mantles of cotton wool: which the Indians signified
by signs that they had from the west: and that holding that course
they should draw near to the land of the Christians. But though they
were much discontented with it, and it grieved many to go backward,
which would rather have adventured their lives and have died in the
land of <i>Florida</i>, than to have gone poor out of it; yet were they not
a sufficient part to hinder that which was determined, because the
principal men agreed with the Governor. And afterward there was
one that said, he would put out one of his own eyes, to put out another
of <i>Luys de Moscoso</i>; because it would grieve him much to see him
prosper: because as well himself as others of his friends had crossed
that which he durst not have done, seeing that within two days he
should leave the government. From <i>Daycao</i>, where now they were,
to <i>Rio Grande</i>, or the Great River, was one hundred and fifty leagues:
which unto that place they had gone westward. And by the way as
they returned back they had much ado to find maize to eat: for where
they had passed the country was destroyed; and some little maize
that was left the Indians had hidden. The towns which in <i>Naguatex</i>
they had burned (whereof it repented them) were repaired again, and
the houses full of maize. This country is well inhabited and plentiful.
In that place are vessels made of clay, which differ very little
from those of <i>Estremoz</i>, or <i>Montemor</i>. In <i>Chaguate</i> the Indians by
commandment of the cacique came peaceably, and said, that the
Christian which remained there would not come. The Governor wrote
unto him, and sent him ink and paper that he might answer. The
substance of the words of the letter was to declare unto him his determination,
which was to go out of the land of <i>Florida</i>, and to put
him in remembrance that he was a Christian, that he would not remain
in the subjection of infidels, that he pardoned him the fault
which he had done in going away to the Indians, that he should come
unto him: and if they did stay him, that he would advertise him
thereof by writing. The Indian went with the letter, and came again
without any more answer, than, on the back side, his name and seal,
that they might know he was alive. The Governor sent twelve horsemen
to seek him: but he, which had his spies, so hid himself, that
they could not find him. For want of maize the Governor could not
stay any longer to seek him. He departed from <i>Chaguate</i>, and passed
the river by <i>Aays</i>; going down by it he found a town called <i>Chilano</i>,
which as yet they had not seen. They came to <i>Nilco</i>, and found so
little maize, as could not suffice till they made their ships; because
the Christians, being in <i>Guachoya</i> in the seed time, the Indians for<a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>
fear of them durst not come to sow the grounds of <i>Nilco</i>: and they
knew not thereabout any other country where any maize was: and
that was the most fruitful soil that was thereaway, and where they
had most hope to find it. Every one was confounded, and the most
part thought it bad counsel to come back from the river of <i>Daycao</i>,
and not to have followed their fortune, going that way that went over
land. For by sea it seemed impossible to save themselves, unless
God would work a miracle for them: for there was neither pilot, nor
sea-chart, neither did they know where the river entered into the sea,
neither had they notice of it, neither had they anything wherewith to
make sails, nor any store of enequem, which is a grass whereof they
make oakum, which grew there; and that which they found they
saved to caulk the pinnaces withal; neither had they anything to
pitch them withal; neither could they make ships of such substance,
but that any storm would put them in great danger: and they feared
much it would fall out with them, as it did with <i>Pamphilo de Narvaez</i>,
which was cast away upon that coast. And above all other it
troubled them most, that they could find no maize: for without it they
could not be sustained, nor could do anything that they had need of.
All of them were put to great confusion. Their chief remedy was to
commit themselves to God, and to beseech him that he would direct
them the way that they might save their lives. And it pleased him
of his goodness, that the Indians of <i>Nilco</i> came peaceably, and told
them, that two days' journey from thence, near unto the Great River,
were two towns, whereof the Christians had no notice, and that the
province was called <i>Minoya</i>, and was a fruitful soil: that, whether at
this present there was any maize or no, they knew not, because they
had war with them: but that they would be very glad with the favor
of the Christians to go and spoil them. The Governor sent a captain
thither with horsemen and footmen, and the Indians of <i>Nilco</i>
with him. He came to <i>Minoya</i>, and found two great towns seated in
a plain and open soil, half a league distant, one in sight of another,
and in them he took many Indians, and found great store of maize.
Presently he lodged in one of them, and sent word to the Governor
what he had found: wherewith they were all exceeding glad. They
departed from <i>Nilco</i> in the beginning of December; and all that way,
and before from <i>Chilano</i>, they endured much trouble: for they passed
through many waters, and many times it rained, with a northern wind,
and was exceeding cold, so that they were in the open field with water
over and underneath them: and when at the end of their day's journey,
they found dry ground to rest upon, they gave great thanks to<a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>
God. With this trouble almost all the Indians that served them died.
And after they were in <i>Minoya</i>, many Christians also died: and the
most part were sick of great and dangerous diseases, which had a
spice of the lethargy. At this place died <i>Andrew de Vasconcelos</i>,
and two Portuguese of <i>Elvas</i>, which were very near him: which were
brethren, and by their surname called <i>Sotis</i>. The Christians lodged
in one of the towns which they liked best, which was fenced about,
and distant a quarter of a league from the Great River. The maize
that was in the other town was brought thither; and in all it was
esteemed to be six thousand hanegs or bushels. And there was the
best timber to make ships that they had seen in all the land of
<i>Florida</i>; wherefore all of them gave God great thanks for so singular
a favor, and hoped that that which they desired would take effect,
which was, that they might safely be conducted into the land of the
Christians.</p>

<p>As soon as they came to <i>Minoya</i>, the Governor commanded them
to gather all the chains together, which every one had to lead Indians
in; and to gather all the iron which they had for their provision, and
all the rest that was in the camp: and to set up a forge to make nails,
and commanded them to cut down timber for the brigantines. And
a Portuguese of <i>Ceuta</i>, who having been a prisoner in <i>Fez</i>, had
learned to saw timber with a long saw, which for such purposes they
had carried with them, did teach others, which helped him to saw
timber. And a <i>Genevese</i>, whom it pleased God to preserve (for without
him they had never come out of the country, for there was never
another that could make ships but he), with four or five other <i>Biscayan</i>
carpenters, which hewed his planks and other timbers, made the
brigantines: and two calkers, the one of <i>Geneva</i>, the other of <i>Sardinia</i>,
did calk them with the tow of an herb like hemp, whereof
before I have made mention, which there is named enequen. And
because there was not enough of it, they calked them with the flax
of the country, and with the mantles, which they raveled for that
purpose. A cooper which they had among them fell sick, and was at
the point of death: and there was none other that had any skill in
that trade: it pleased God to send him his health. And albeit he
was very weak, and could not labor, yet fifteen days before they departed,
he made for every brigantine two half hogsheads, which
the mariners call quarterets, because four of them hold a pipe
of water. The Indians which dwelt two days' journey above the
river in a province called <i>Taguanate</i>, and likewise those of <i>Nilco</i> and<a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>
<i>Guachoya</i>, and others their neighbors seeing the brigantines in making,
thinking, because their places of refuge are in the water, that they
were to go to seek them, and because the Governor demanded mantles
of them, as necessary for sails, came many times, and brought
many mantles, and great store of fish. And for certain it seemed
that God was willing to favor them in so great necessity, moving the
minds of the Indians to bring them: for to go to take them, they
were never able. For in the town where they were, as soon as winter
came, they were so enclosed and compassed with water, that they
could go no farther by land, than a league, and a league and a half.
And if they would go farther, they could carry no horses, and without
them they were not able to fight with the Indians, because they were
many: and so many for so many on foot they had the advantage of
them by water and by land, because they were more apt and lighter,
and by reason of the disposition of the country, which was according
to their desire for the use of their war. They brought also some
cords, and those which wanted for cables were made of the barks of
mulberry trees. They made stirrups of wood, and made anchors of
their stirrups. In the month of March, when it had rained a month
before, the river grew so big that it came to <i>Nilco</i>, which was nine
leagues of: and on the other side, the Indians said, that it reached
other nine leagues into the land. In the town where the Christians
were, which was somewhat high ground, where they could best go,
the water reached to the stirrups. They made certain rafts of timber,
and laid many boughs upon them, whereon they set their horses,
and in the houses they did the like. But seeing that nothing prevailed,
they went up to the lofts: and if they went out of the houses,
it was in canoes, or on horseback in those places where the ground
was highest. So they were two months, and could do nothing, during
which time the river decreased not. The Indians ceased not to come
unto the brigantines as they were wont, and came in canoes. At that
time the Governor feared they would set upon him. He commanded
his men to take an Indian secretly of those that came to the town,
and to stay him till the rest were gone: and they took one. The
Governor commanded him to be put to torture, to make him confess
whether the Indians did practice any treason or no. He confessed
that the caciques of <i>Nilco</i>, <i>Guachoya</i>, and <i>Taguanate</i>, and others,
which in all were about twenty caciques, with a great number of
people, determined to come upon him; and that three days before,
they would send a great present of fish to cover their great treason
and malice, and on the very day they would send some Indians before<a name="page_205" id="page_205"></a>
with another present. And these, with those which were our slaves,
which were of their conspiracy also, should set the houses on fire, and
first of all possess themselves of the lances which stood at the doors
of the houses; and the caciques, with all their men, should be near
the town in ambush in the wood, and when they saw the fire
kindled, should come, and make an end of the conquest. The Governor
commanded the Indian to be kept in a chain, and the selfsame
day that he spoke of, there came thirty Indians with fish. He
commanded their right hands to be cut off, and sent them so back to
the Cacique of <i>Guachoya</i>, whose men they were. He sent him word
that he and the rest should come when they would, for he desired
nothing more, and that he should know, that they thought not anything
which he knew not before they thought of it. Hereupon they
all were put in a very great fear: and the caciques of <i>Nilco</i> and
<i>Taguanate</i> came to excuse themselves: and a few days after came he
of <i>Guachoya</i>, and a principal Indian, and his subject, said, he knew
by certain information, that the caciques of <i>Nilco</i> and <i>Taguanate</i>
were agreed to come and make war upon the Christians. As soon as
the Indians came from <i>Nilco</i>, the Governor examined them, and they
confessed it was true. He delivered them presently to the principal
men of <i>Guachoya</i>, which drew them out of the town and killed them.
Another day came some from <i>Taguanate</i>, and confessed it likewise.
The Governor commanded their right hands and noses to be cut off,
and sent them to the cacique, wherewith they of <i>Guachoya</i> remained
very well contented: and they came oftentimes with presents of mantles
and fish, and hogs, which bred in the country of some swine that
were lost by the way the last year. As soon as the waters were
slaked, they persuaded the Governor to send to <i>Taguanate</i>. They
came and brought canoes, wherein the footmen were conveyed down
the river, and a captain with horsemen went by land; and the Indians
of <i>Guachoya</i>, which guided him till they came to <i>Taguanate</i>, assaulted
the town, and took many men and women, and mantles, which
with those that they had already were sufficient to supply their want.
The brigantines being finished in the month of June, the Indians
having told us that the river increased but once a year, when the
snows did melt, in the time wherein I mentioned it had already increased,
being now in summer, and having not rained a long time, it
pleased God that the flood came up to the town to seek the brigantines,
from whence they carried them by water to the river. Which,
if they had gone by land, had been in danger of breaking and splitting
their keels, and to be all undone; because that for want of iron,<a name="page_206" id="page_206"></a>
the spikes were short, and the planks and timber were very weak.
The Indians of <i>Minoya</i>, during the time that they were there came
to serve them (being driven thereunto by necessity) that of the maize
which they had taken from them, they would bestow some crumbs
upon them, and because the country was fertile, and the people used
to feed of maize, and the Christians had gotten all from them that
they had, and the people were many, they were not able to sustain
themselves. Those which came to the town were so weak and feeble,
that they had no flesh left on their bones: and many came and died
near the town for pure hunger and weakness. The Governor commanded
upon grievous punishments to give them no maize. Yet,
when they saw that the hogs wanted it not, and that they had yielded
themselves to serve them, and considering their misery and wretchedness,
having pity of them, they gave them part of the maize which
they had. And when the time of their embarkment came, there was
not sufficient to serve their own turns. That which there was, they
put into the brigantines, and into great canoes tied two and two together.
They shipped twenty-two of the best horses that were in
the camp, the rest they made dried flesh of; and dressed the hogs
which they had in like manner. They departed from <i>Minoya</i> the
second day of July, 1543.</p>

<p>The day before they departed from <i>Minoya</i>, they determined to
dismiss all the men and women of the country, which they had detained
as slaves to serve them, save some hundred, little more or less,
which the Governor embarked, and others whom it pleased him to
permit. And because there were many men of quality, whom he
could not deny that which he granted to others, he used a policy,
saying, that they might serve them as long as they were in the river,
but when they came to the sea, they must send them away for want
of water, because they had but few vessels. He told his friends in
secret, that they should carry theirs to <i>Nueva España</i>: and all
those whom he bare no good-will unto (which were the greater number)
ignorant of that which was hidden from them, which afterward
time discovered, thinking it inhumanity for so little time of service, in
reward of the great service that they had done them, to carry them
with them, to leave them slaves to other men out of their own countries,
left five hundred men and women; among whom were many
boys and girls, which spake and understood the Spanish tongue.
The most of them did nothing but weep; which moved great compassion;
seeing that all of them with good-will would have become<a name="page_207" id="page_207"></a>
Christians, and were left in state of perdition. There went from
<i>Minoya</i> three hundred and twenty-two Spaniards in seven brigantines,
well made, save that the planks were thin, because the nails
were short, and were not pitched, nor had any decks to keep the
water from coming in. Instead of decks they laid planks, whereon
the mariners might run to trim their sails, and the people might refresh
themselves above and below. The Governor made his captains,
and gave to every one his brigantine, and took their oath and their
word, that they would obey him, until they came to the land of the
Christians. The Governor took one of the brigantines for himself,
which he best liked. The same day that they departed from <i>Minoya</i>,
they passed by <i>Guachoya</i>, where the Indians tarried for them in
canoes by the river. And on the shore, they had made a great arbor
with boughs. They desired him to come on shore; but he excused
himself, and so went along. The Indians in their canoes accompanied
him; and coming where an arm of the river declined on the right
hand, they said that the Province of <i>Quigalta</i> was near unto that
place, and importuned the Governor to set upon him, and that they
would aid him. And because they had said that he dwelt three days'
journey down the river, the Governor supposed that they had plotted
some treason against him, and there left them; and went down with
the greatest force of the water. The current was very strong, and
with the help of oars, they went very swiftly. The first day they
landed in a wood on the left hand of the river, and at night they
withdrew themselves to the brigantines. The next day they came to
a town where they went on shore, and the people that was in it durst
not tarry. A woman that they took there being examined, said, that
the town belonged to a cacique named <i>Huasene</i>, subject to <i>Quigalta</i>,
and that <i>Quigalta</i> tarried for them below in the river with many men.
Certain horsemen went thither, and found some houses, wherein was
much maize. Immediately more of them went thither and tarried
there one day, and which they did beat out, and took as much maize
as they needed. While they were there, many Indians came from
the nether part of the river, and on the other side right against them
somewhat carelessly set themselves in order to fight. The Governor
sent in two canoes the crossbow-men that he had, and as many more
as could go in them. They ran away, and seeing the Spaniards could
not overtake them, they returned back, and took courage; and coming
nearer, making an outcry, they threatened them: and as soon as
they departed thence, they went after them, some in canoes and some<a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a>
by land along the river; and getting before, coming to a town that
stood by the river's side, they joined altogether, making a show that
they would tarry there. Every brigantine towed a canoe fastened to
their sterns for their particular service. Presently there entered men
into every one of them, which made the Indians to fly, and burned
the town. The same day they presently landed in a great field, where
the Indians durst not tarry. The next day there were gathered together
an hundred canoes, among which were some that carried sixty
and seventy men, and the principal men's canoes had their tilts, and
plumes of white and red feathers for their ensigns: and they came
within two crossbow shots of the brigantines, and sent three Indians
in a small canoe with a feigned message to view the manner of the
brigantines, and what weapons they had. And coming to the side
of the Governor's brigantine, one of the Indians entered, and said:</p>

<p>"That the Cacique of <i>Quigalta</i>, his lord, sent him his commendations,
and did let him understand, that all that the Indians of
<i>Guachoya</i> had told him concerning himself, was false, and that they
had incensed him, because they were his enemies; that he was his
servant, and should find him so."</p>

<p>The Governor answered him, that he believed all that he said was
true, and willed him to tell him that he esteemed his friendship very
much. With this answer they returned to the place where the rest
in their canoes were waiting for them, and from thence all of them
fell down, and came near the Spaniards, shouting aloud, and threatening
of them. The Governor sent <i>John de Guzman</i>, which had been
a captain of footmen in <i>Florida</i>, with fifteen armed men in canoes to
make them give way. As soon as the Indians saw them come
towards them, they divided themselves into two parts, and stood still
till the Spaniards came nigh them, and when they were came near
them, they joined together on both sides, taking <i>John de Guzman</i> in
the middle, and them that came first with him, and with great fury
boarded them: and as their canoes were bigger, and many of them
leaped into the water to stay them, and to lay hold on the canoes of
the Spaniards, and overwhelm them; so presently they overwhelmed
them. The Christians fell into the water, and with the weight of
their armor sunk down to the bottom; and some few, that by swimming
or holding by the canoe could have saved themselves, with
oars and staves which they had, they struck them on the head and
make them sink. When they of the brigantines saw the overthrow,
though they went about to succor them, yet through the current of<a name="page_209" id="page_209"></a>
the river they could not go back. Four Spaniards fled to the brigantine
that was nearest to the canoes; and only these escaped of those
that came among the Indians. There were eleven that died there:
among whom <i>John de Guzman</i> was one, and a son of <i>Don Carlos</i>,
called <i>John de Vargas</i>: the rest also were persons of account and men
of great courage. Those that escaped by swimming said that they
saw the Indians enter the canoe of <i>John de Guzman</i> at the stern of
one of their canoes, and whether they carried him away dead or alive
they could not certainly tell.</p>

<p>The Indians, seeing that they had got the victory, took such courage,
that they assaulted them in the brigantines, which they durst
not do before. They came first to that brigantine wherein <i>Calderon</i>
went for captain, and was in the rearward: and at the first volley of
arrows they wounded twenty-five men. There were only four armed
men in this brigantine; these did stand at the brigantine's side to defend
it. Those that were unarmed, seeing how they hurt them, left
their oars and went under the deck: whereupon the brigantine began
to cross, and to go where the current of the stream carried it. One
of the armed men seeing this, without the commandment of the captain,
made a footman to take an oar and steer the brigantine, he standing
before him and defending him with his target. The Indians came
no nearer than a bowshot, from whence they offended and were not
offended, receiving no hurt: for in every brigantine was but one
crossbow, and those which we had were very much out of order. So
that the Christians did nothing else but stand for a butt to receive
their arrows. Having left this brigantine they went to another, and
fought with it half an hour; and so from one to another they fought
with them all. The Christians had mats to lay under them, which
were double, and so close and strong, that no arrow went through
them. And as soon as the Indians gave them leisure, they fenced
the brigantines with them. And the Indians seeing that they could
not shoot level, shot their arrows at random up in the air, which fell
into the brigantines, and hurt some of the men: and not therewith
contented, they sought to get to them which were in the canoes with
the horses. Those of the brigantines environed them to defend them,
and took them among them. Thus seeing themselves much vexed by
them, and so wearied that they could no longer endure it, they determined
to travel all the night following, thinking to get beyond the
country of <i>Quigalta</i>, and that they would leave them: but when they
thought least of it, supposing that they had now left them, they heard<a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a>
very near them so great outcries, that they made them deaf, and so
they followed us all that night, and the next day till noon, by which
time we were come into the country of others, whom they desired to
use us after the same manner; and so they did. The men of <i>Quigalta</i>
returned home; and the other in fifty canoes fought with us a whole
day and a night; and they entered one of the brigantines, that came
in the rearward, by the canoe which she had at her stern, and took
away a woman which they found in it, and afterwards hurt some of
the men in the brigantines. Those which came with the horses in
the canoes, being wearied with rowing night and day, lingered behind;
and presently the Indians came upon them, and they of the
brigantines tarried for them. The Governor resolved to go on shore
and kill the horses, because of the slow way which they made because
of them. As soon as they saw a place convenient for it, they
went thither and killed the horses, and brought the flesh of them to
dry it on board. Four or five of them remained on shore alive; the
Indians went unto them, after the Spaniards were embarked. The
horses were not acquainted with them, and began to neigh, and run
up and down in such sort, that the Indians, for fear of them, leaped
into the water; and getting into their canoes went after the brigantines,
shooting cruelly at them. They followed us that evening and
the night following till the next day at ten of the clock, and then returned
up the river. Presently from a small town that stood upon
the river came seven canoes, and followed us a little way down the
river, shooting at us: but seeing they were so few that they could do
us but little harm, they returned to their town. From thence forward,
until they came to the sea, they had no encounter. They
sailed down the river seventeen days: which may be two hundred and
fifty leagues' journey, little more or less: and near unto the sea, the
river is divided into two arms; each of them is a league and a half
broad.</p>

<p>Half a league before they came to the sea, they came to anchor to
rest themselves there about a day; for they were very weary with
rowing, and out of heart. For by the space of many days they had
eaten nothing but parched and sodden maize; which they had by
allowance every day an headpiece full by strike for every three men.
While they rode there at anchor seven canoes of Indians came to set
upon those which they brought with them. The Governor commanded
armed men to go aboard them, and to drive them farther off.
They came also against them by land through a thick wood, and a<a name="page_211" id="page_211"></a>
moorish ground, and had staves with very sharp forked heads made
of the bones of fishes, and fought very valiantly with us, which went
out to encounter them. And the other that came in canoes with their
arrows staid for them that came against them, and at their coming
both those that were on land, and those in the canoes wounded some
of us: and seeing us come near them, they turned their backs, and
like swift horses among footmen got away from us; making some
returns, and reuniting themselves together, going not past a bow shot
off: for in so retiring they shot, without receiving any hurt of the
Christians. For though they had some bows, yet they could not use
them; and brake their arms with rowing to overtake them. And the
Indians easily in their compass went with their canoes, staying and
wheeling about as it had been in a skirmish, perceiving that those
that came against them could not offend them. And the more they
strove to come near them, the more hurt they received. As soon as
they had driven them farther off, they returned to the brigantines.
They stayed two days there: and departed from thence unto the place
where the arm of the river entereth into the sea. They sounded in
the river near unto the sea, and found forty fathoms water. They
staid there. And the Governor commanded all and singular persons
to speak their minds touching their voyage, whether it were best to
cross over to <i>Nueva España</i>, committing themselves to the high sea,
or whether they should keep along the coast. There were sundry
opinions touching this matter: wherein <i>John Danusco</i>, which presumed
much, and took much upon him in the knowledge of navigation, and
matters of the sea, although he had but little experience, moved
the Governor with his talk: and his opinion was seconded by some
others. And they affirmed, that it was much better to pass by the
high sea, and cross the gulf, which was three of four parts the lesser
travel, because in going along the coast, they went a great way about,
by reason of the compass which the land did make. <i>John Danusco</i>
said, that he had seen the sea-card, and that from the place where they
were, the coast ran east and west unto <i>Rio de las Palmas</i>; and from
<i>Rio de las Palmas</i> to <i>Nueva España</i> from north to south: and therefore
in sailing always in sight of land would be a great compassing about
and spending of much time; and that they would be in great danger
to be overtaken with winter before they should get to the land of
the Christians: and that in ten or twelve days' space, having good
weather, they might be there in crossing over. The most part were
against this opinion, and said that it was more safe to go along the
coast, though they staid the longer: because their ships were very<a name="page_212" id="page_212"></a>
weak and without decks, so that a very little storm was enough to
cast them away: and if they should be hindered with calms, or contrary
weather, through the small store of vessels which they had to
carry water in, they should likewise fall into great danger: and that
although the ships were such as they might venture in them, yet having
neither pilot nor sea-card to guide themselves, it was no good
counsel to cross the gulf. This opinion was confirmed by the greatest
part: and they agreed to go along the coast. At the time wherein
they sought to depart from thence, the cable of the anchor of the Governor's
brigantine brake, and the anchor remained in the river. And
albeit they were near the shore, yet it was so deep, that the divers
diving many times could never find it; which caused great sadness in
the Governor, and in all those that went with him in his brigantine:
but with a grindstone which they had, and certain bridles which
remained to some of the gentlemen, and men of worship which had
horses, they made a weight which served instead of an anchor. The
18th of July (1543) they went forth to sea with fair and prosperous
weather for their voyage. And seeing that they were gone two or
three leagues from the shore, the captains of the other brigantines
overtook them, and asked the Governor, wherefore he did put off from
the shore? and that if he would leave the coast, he should say so;
and he should not do it without the consent of all: and that if he did
otherwise, they would not follow him, but that every one would do
what seemed best unto himself. The Governor answered, that he
would do nothing without their counsel, but that he did bear off from
the land to sail the better and safer by night; and that the next day
when time served, he would return to the sight of land again. They
sailed with a reasonable good wind that day and the night following,
and the next day till evening song, always in fresh water; whereat
they wondered much: for they were very far from land. But the
force of the current of the river is so great, and the coast there is so
shallow and gentle, that the fresh water enters far into the sea.
That evening on their right hand they saw certain creeks, whither
they went, and rested there that night: where <i>John Danusco</i> with his
reasons won them at last, that all consented and agreed to commit
themselves to the main sea, alleging, as he had done before, that it
was a great advantage, and that their voyage would be much shorter.
They sailed two days, and when they would have come to sight of
land they could not, for the wind blew from the shore. On the fourth
day, seeing their fresh water began to fail, fearing necessity and
danger, they all complained of <i>John Danusco</i>, and of the Governor<a name="page_213" id="page_213"></a>
that followed his counsel: and every one of the captains said, that
they would no more go from the shore, though the Governor went
whither he would. It pleased God that the wind changed, though but
a little: and at the end of four days after they had put to sea, being
already destitute of water, by force of rowing they got within sight of
land, and with great trouble recovered it, in an open road. That
evening the wind came to the south, which on that coast is a cross
wind, and drove the brigantines against the shore, because it blew very
hard, and the anchors were so weak, that they yielded and began to
bend. The Governor commanded all men to leap into the water, and
going between them and the shore, and thrusting the brigantines into
the sea as soon as the wave was past, they saved them till the wind
ceased.</p>

<p>In the bay where they rode, after the tempest was passed, they
went on shore, and with mattocks, which they had, they digged certain
pits, which grew full of fresh water, where they filled all the casks
they had. The next day they departed thence, and sailed two days,
and entered into a creek like unto a pool, fenced from the south
wind, which then did blow, and was against them; and there they
stayed four days, not being able to get out; and when the sea was
calm they rowed out. They sailed that day, and towards evening
the wind grew so strong that it drove them on the shore, and they
were sorry that they had put forth from the former harbor; for as
soon as night approached, a storm began to rise in the sea, and the
wind still waxed more violent with a tempest. The brigantines lost
one another. Two of them, which bare more into the sea, entered
into an arm of the sea, which pierced into the land two leagues
beyond the place where the others were that night. The five which
stayed behind, being always a league and half a league the one from
the other, met together, without any knowledge the one of the other,
in a wild road, where the wind and the waves drove them on shore;
for their anchors did straighten and came home, and they could not
use their oars, putting seven or eight men to every one, which rowed
to seaward; and all the rest leaped into the water, and when the wave
was passed that drave the brigantine on shore, they thrust it again
into the sea with all the diligence and might that they had. Others,
while another wave was incoming, with bowls laved out the water
that came in overboard. While they were in this tempest, in
great fear of being cast away in that place, from midnight forward
they endured an intolerable torment of an infinite swarm of mosquitoes
which fell upon them, which as soon as they had stung the flesh, it so<a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a>
infected it, as though they had been venomous. In the morning the
sea was assuaged and the wind slacked, but not the mosquitoes; for
the sails, which were white, seemed black with them in the morning.
Those which rowed, unless others kept them away, were not able to
row. Having passed the fear and danger of the storm, beholding the
deformities of their faces, and the blows which they gave themselves
to drive them away, one of them laughed at another. They met all
together in the creek where the two brigantines were which outwent
their fellows. There was found a scum which they call copee, which
the sea casteth up, and it is like pitch, wherewith in some places,
where pitch is wanting, they pitch their ships; there they pitched
their brigantines. They rested two days, and then eftsoons proceeded
on their voyage. They sailed two days more, and landed in a
bay or arm of the sea, where they stayed two days. The same day
that they went from thence six men went up in a canoe toward the
head of it, and could not see the end of it. They put out from
thence with a south wind, which was against them; but because it
was little, and for the great desire they had to shorten their voyage,
they put out to sea by the force of oars, and for all that made very
little way, with great labor, in two days, and went under the lee of a
small island into an arm of the sea, which compassed it about.
While they were there, there fell out such weather, that they gave
God many thanks that they found out such an harbor. There was
great store of fish in that place, which they took with nets, which
they had, and hooks. Here a man cast an hook and a line into the
sea, and tied the end of it to his arm, and a fish caught it, and drew
him into the water unto the neck; and it pleased God that he remembered
himself of a knife that he had, and cut the line with it.
There they abode fourteen days; and at the end of them it pleased
God to send them fair weather, for which, with great devotion, they
appointed a procession, and went in procession along the strand, beseeching
God to bring them to a land where they might serve him in
better sort.</p>

<p>In all the coast wheresoever they digged they found fresh water;
there they filled their vessels, and the procession being ended, embarked
themselves, and going always in sight of the shore they sailed
six days. <i>John Danusco</i> said that it would do well to bear out to
seaward; for he had seen the sea-card, and remembered that from <i>Rio
de las Palmas</i> forward, the coast did run from north to south, and
thitherto they had run from east to west, and in his opinion, by his
reckoning, <i>Rio de las Palmas</i> could not be far off from where they<a name="page_215" id="page_215"></a>
were. That same night they put to sea, and in the morning they saw
palm leaves floating, and the coast which ran north and south. From
midday forward they saw great mountains, which until then they had
not seen; for from this place to <i>Puerto de Spiritu Santo</i>, where they
first landed in <i>Florida</i>, was a very plain and low country; and therefore
it cannot be descried, unless a man comes very near it. By that
which they saw, they thought they had overshot <i>Rio de Palmas</i> that
night, which is sixty leagues from the river <i>Panuco</i>, which is in
<i>Nueva España</i>. They assembled all together, and some said it
was not good to sail by night, lest they should overshoot the river of
<i>Panuco</i>; and others said, it was not well to lose time while it was
favorable, and that it could not be so near that they should pass it
that night; and they agreed to take away half the sails, and so sail
all night. Two of the brigantines, which sailed that night with all
their sails, by break of day had overshot the river of <i>Panuco</i> without
seeing it. Of the five that came behind, the first that came unto it
was that wherein <i>Calderan</i> was captain. A quarter of a league before
they came at it, and before they did see it, they saw the water
muddy, and knew it to be fresh water; and coming right against the
river, they saw where it entered into the sea, that the water broke upon
a shoal. And because there was no man there that knew it, they
were in doubt whether they should go in, or go along; and they resolved
to go in; and before they came into the current, they went
close to the shore, and entered into the port. And as soon as they
were come in, they saw Indian men and women appareled like Spaniards,
whom they asked in what country they were? They answered
in Spanish, that it was the river of <i>Panuco</i>, and that the town of
the Christians was fifteen leagues up within the land. The joy that
all of them received upon this news cannot sufficiently be expressed;
for it seemed unto them that at that instant they were born again.
And many went on shore and kissed the ground, and kneeling on
their knees, with lifting up their hands and eyes to Heaven, they all
ceased not to give God thanks. Those which came after, as soon as
they saw <i>Calderan</i> come to an anchor with his brigantine in the
river, presently went thither, and came into the haven. The other
two brigantines which had overshot the place, put to sea to return
back to seek the rest, and could not do it, because the wind was contrary
and the sea grown; they were afraid of being cast away, and
recovering the shore they cast anchor. While they rode there a
storm arose, and seeing that they could not abide there, much less<a name="page_216" id="page_216"></a>
endure at sea, they resolved to run on shore; and as the brigantines
were but small, so did they draw but little water; and where they
were it was a sandy coast. By which occasion the force of their sails
drove them on shore, without any hurt of them that were in them.
As those that were in the port of <i>Panuco</i> at this time were in great
joy; so these felt a double grief in their hearts, for they knew not
what was become of their fellows, nor in what country they were, and
feared it was a country of Indian enemies. They landed two leagues
below the port; and when they saw themselves out of the danger of
the sea, every one took of that which he had, as much as he could carry
on his back, and they traveled up into the country, and found Indians,
which told them where their fellows were, and gave them good entertainment;
wherewith their sadness was turned into joy, and they
thanked God most humbly for their deliverance out of so many
dangers.</p>

<p>From the time that they put out of <i>Rio Grande</i> to the sea, at
their departure from <i>Florida</i>, until they arrived in the river of <i>Panuco</i>,
was fifty-two days. They came into the river of <i>Panuco</i> the
tenth of September, 1543. They went up the river with their brigantines.
They traveled four days; and because the wind was but
little, and many times it served them not because of the many turnings
which the river maketh, and the great current drawing them up
by towing, and that in many places; for this cause they made very
little way and with great labor; and seeing the execution of their desire
to be deferred, which was to come among Christians, and to see
the celebration of divine service, which so long time they had not
seen, they left the brigantines with the mariners, and went by land
to <i>Panuco</i>. All of them were appareled in deers' skins tanned and
dyed black, to wit, coats, hose, and shoes. When they came to <i>Panuco</i>,
presently they went to the church to pray and give God thanks
that so miraculously had saved them. The townsmen which before
were advertised by the Indians, and knew of their arrival, carried
some of them to their houses, and entertained them whom they knew
and had acquaintance of, or because they were their countrymen.
The Alcalde Mayor took the Governor home to his house: and commanded
all the rest, as soon as they came, to be lodged six and six
and ten and ten, according to the ability of every townsman. And all
of them were provided for by their hosts of many hens, and bread of
maize, and fruits of the country, which are such as be in the Isle of
<i>Cuba</i>, whereof before I have spoken. The town of <i>Panuco</i> may contain
about seventy families; the most of their houses are of lime and<a name="page_217" id="page_217"></a>
stone, and some made of timber, and all of them are thatched. It is a
poor country, and there is neither gold nor silver in it. The inhabitants
live there in great abundance of victuals and servants. The richest
have not above five hundred crowns rent a year, and that is in cotton
cloths, hens, and maize, which the Indians their servants do give
them for tribute. There arrived there of those that came out of
<i>Florida</i>, three hundred and eleven Christians. Presently the Alcalde
Mayor sent one of the townsmen in post to advertise the Viceroy,
<i>Don Antonio de Mendoça</i>, which was resident in <i>Mexico</i>, that of the
people that went with <i>Don Ferdinando de Soto</i> to discover and conquer
<i>Florida</i> three hundred and eleven men were arrived there, that
seeing that they were employed in his majesty's service he would take
some order to provide for them. Whereat the Viceroy, and all the
inhabitants of <i>Mexico</i> wondered; for they thought they were miscarried
because they had traveled so far within the main land of <i>Florida</i>,
and had no news of them for so long a time: and it seemed a
wonderful thing unto them, how they could save themselves so long
among infidels, without any fort, wherein they might fortify themselves,
and without any other succor at all. Presently the Viceroy
sent a warrant wherein he commanded, that whithersoever they sent
they should give them victuals, and as many Indians for their carriages
as they needed: and where they would not furnish them, they
might take those things that were necessary perforce without incurring
any danger of law. This warrant was so readily obeyed that by
the way before they came to the towns they came to receive them
with hens and victuals.</p>

<p>From <i>Panuco</i> to the great city of <i>Temistitan, Mexico</i>, is sixty
leagues; and other sixty from <i>Panuco</i> to the port de <i>Vera Cruz</i>, where
they take shipping for <i>Spain</i>, and those that come from <i>Spain</i> do
land to go for <i>Nueva España</i>. These three towns stand in a triangle:
to wit, <i>Vera Cruz</i> to the south, <i>Panuco</i> to the north, and
<i>Mexico</i> to the west sixty leagues asunder. The country is so inhabited
with Indians that from town to town those which are farthest are but
a league and half a league asunder. Some of them that came from
<i>Florida</i> stayed a month in <i>Panuco</i> to rest themselves, others fifteen
days, and every one as long as he listed: for there was none that showed
a sour countenance to his guests, but rather gave them anything that
they had, and seemed to be grieved when they took their leave. Which
was to be believed; for the victuals which the Indians do pay them
for tribute, are more than they can spend: and in that town is no
commerce; and there dwelt but few Spaniards there, and they were<a name="page_218" id="page_218"></a>
glad of their company. The Alcalde Mayor divided all the Emperor's
clothes which he had (which there they pay him for his tribute)
among those that would come to receive them. Those which had
shirts of mail left were glad men; for they had a horse for one shirt
of mail. Some horsed themselves; and such as could not (which
were the greatest part) took their journey on foot: in which they
were well received of the Indians that were in the towns, and better
served than they could have been in their own houses, though they
had been well to live. For if they asked one hen of an Indian, they
brought them four: and if they asked any of the country fruit though
it were a league off, they ran presently for it. And if any Christian
found himself evil at ease, they carried him in a chair from one town
to another. In whatsoever town they came, the cacique, by an Indian
which carried a rod of justice in his hand, whom they call Tapile,
that is to say a sergeant, commanded them to provide victuals for
them, and Indians to bear burdens of such things as they had, and
such as were needful to carry them that were sick. The Viceroy sent
a Portuguese twenty leagues from <i>Mexico</i>, with great store of sugar,
raisins of the sun, conserves, and other things fit for sick folks, for
such as had need of them: and had given order to clothe them all at
the Emperor's charge. And their approach being known by the citizens
of <i>Mexico</i>, they went out of the town to receive them: and with
great courtesy, requesting them in favor to come to their houses, every
one carried such as he met home with him, and clothed them every
one the best they could: so that he that had the meanest apparel, it
cost about thirty ducats. As many as were willing to come to the
Viceroy's house he commanded to be appareled, and such as were persons
of quality sate at his table: and there was a table in his house
for as many of the meaner sort as would come to it: and he was presently
informed who every one was, to show him the courtesy that he
deserved. Some of the conquerors did set both gentlemen and clowns
at their own table, and many times made the servant sit cheek by
cheek by his master: and chiefly the officers and men of base condition
did so: for those which had better education did inquire who
every one was, and made difference of persons: but all did what they
could with a good will: and every one told them whom they had in
their houses, that they should not trouble themselves, nor think themselves
the worse, to take that which they gave them: for they had
been in the like case, and had been relieved of others, and that this
was the custom of that country. God reward them all: and God
grant that those which it pleased him to deliver out of <i>Florida</i>, and<a name="page_219" id="page_219"></a>
to bring again into Christendom, may serve him: and unto those that
died in that country, and unto all that believe in Him and confess
his holy faith, God for his mercy's sake grant the kingdom of heaven.
Amen.</p>

<p>From the <i>Port de Spiritu Santo</i>, where they landed when they
entered into <i>Florida</i>, to the Province of Ocute, which may be 400
leagues, little more or less, is a very plain country, and has many
lakes and thick woods, and in some places they are of wild pine-trees;
and is a weak soil. There is in it neither mountain nor hill. The
country of <i>Ocute</i> is more fat and fruitful; it has thinner woods, and
very goodly meadows upon the rivers. From <i>Ocute</i> to <i>Cutifachiqui</i>
may be 130 leagues: 80 leagues thereof are desert, and have many
groves of wild pine trees. Through the wilderness great rivers do
pass. From <i>Cutifachiqui</i> to <i>Xuala</i>, may be 250 leagues: it is all an
hilly country. <i>Cutifachiqui</i> and <i>Xuala</i> stand both in plain ground,
high, and have goodly meadows on the rivers. From thence forward
to <i>Chiaha</i>, <i>Coça</i>, and <i>Talise</i>, is plain ground, dry and fat, and very
plentiful of maize. From <i>Xuala</i> to <i>Tascaluça</i> may be 250 leagues.
From <i>Tascaluça</i> to <i>Rio Grande</i>, or the Great River, may be 300
leagues: the country is low, and full of lakes. From <i>Rio Grande</i>
forward, the country is higher and more champaign, and best peopled
of all the land of <i>Florida</i>. And along this river from <i>Aquixo</i> to
<i>Pacaha</i>, and <i>Coligoa</i>, are 150 leagues: the country is plain, and the
woods thin, and in some places champaign, very fruitful and pleasant.
From <i>Coligoa</i> to <i>Autiamque</i> are 250 leagues of hilly country. From
<i>Autiamque</i> to <i>Aguacay</i>, may be 230 leagues of plain ground. From
<i>Aguacay</i> to the river of <i>Daycao</i> 120 leagues, all hilly country.</p>

<p>From the <i>Port de Spiritu Santo</i> unto <i>Apalache</i>, they traveled
from east to west, and north-west. From <i>Cutifachiqui</i> to <i>Xuala</i> from
south to north. From <i>Xuala</i> to <i>Coça</i> from east to west. From
<i>Coça</i> to <i>Tascaluça</i>, and to <i>Rio Grande</i>, as far as the provinces of
<i>Quizquiz</i> and <i>Aquixo</i>, from east to west. From <i>Aquixo</i> to <i>Pacaha</i> to
the north. From <i>Pacaha</i> to <i>Tulla</i> from east to west: from <i>Tulla</i> to
<i>Autiamque</i> from north to south, to the province of <i>Guachoya</i> and
<i>Daycao</i>.</p>

<p>The bread which they ate in all the land of <i>Florida</i> is of maize, which
is like coarse millet. And this maize is common in all the islands,
and from the Antilles forward. There are also in <i>Florida</i> great store
of walnuts, plums, mulberries, and grapes. They sow and gather
their maize every one their several crop. The fruits are common to
all, for they grow abroad in the open fields in great abundance, without<a name="page_220" id="page_220"></a>
any need of planting or dressing. Where there be mountains,
there be chestnuts; they are somewhat smaller than the chestnuts of
<i>Spain</i>. From <i>Rio Grande</i> westward, the walnuts differ from those
that grow more eastward; for they are soft, and like unto acorns; and
those which grow from <i>Rio Grande</i> to <i>Puerto del Spiritu Santo</i> for
the most part are hard; and the trees and walnuts in show like those
of <i>Spain</i>. There is a fruit through all the country which groweth
on a plant like Ligoacan, which the Indians do plant. The fruit is
like unto Peares Riall; it has a very good smell, and an excellent
taste. There groweth another plant in the open field, which beareth a
fruit like unto strawberries, close to the ground, which has a very good
taste. The plums are of two kinds, red and gray, of the making and
bigness of nuts, and have three or four stones in them. These are
better than all the plums of <i>Spain</i>, and they make far better prunes
of them. In the grapes there is only want of dressing; for though
they be big, they have a great kernel. All other fruits are very perfect,
and less hurtful than those of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>There are in <i>Florida</i> many bears and lions, wolves, deer, dogs,
cats, martens, and conies. There be many wild hens as big as turkeys,
partridges small, like those of <i>Africa</i>, cranes, ducks, pigeons, thrushes,
and sparrows. There are certain black birds bigger than sparrows,
and lesser than stares. There are goshawks, falcons, gerfalcons, and
all fowls of prey that are in <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>The Indians are well proportioned. Those of the plain countries
are taller of body, and better shapen, than those of the mountains.
Those of the inland have greater store of maize, and commodities of
the country, than those that dwell upon the sea-coast. The country
along the sea-coast is barren and poor, and the people more warlike.
The coast runneth from <i>Puerto del Spiritu Santo</i> to <i>Apalache</i>, east
and west; and from <i>Apalache</i> to <i>Rio de las Palmas</i> from east to west;
from <i>Rio de las Palmas</i> unto <i>Nueva España</i> from north to south.
It is a gentle coast, but it hath many shoals, and great shelves of sand.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
